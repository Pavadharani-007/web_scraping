p,"A headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-nitrogen-phosphorous detection (HS-SPME-GC-NPD) method using polypyrrole (PPy) fibers has been introduced to determine two derivatives ofpyrrolidone;N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone(NVP) andN-methyl-2-pyrrolidone(NMP). Two types of PPy fibers, prepared using organic and aqueous media, were compared in terms of extraction efficiency and thermal stability. It was found that PPy film prepared using organic medium (i.e. acetonitrile) had higher extraction efficiency and more thermal stability compared to the film prepared in aqueous medium. To enhance the sensitivity of HS-SPME, the effects of pH, ionic strength, extraction time, extraction temperature and the headspace volume on the extraction efficiency were optimized. Using the results of this research, high sensitivity and selectivity had been achieved due to the combination of the high extraction efficiency of PPy film prepared in organic medium and the high sensitivity and selectivity of nitrogen-phosphorous detection. Linear range of the analytes was found to be between 1.0 and 1000 microg L(-1) with regression coefficients (R(2)) of 0.998 and 0.997 forNVPand NMP, consequently. Limits of detection (LODs) were 0.074 and 0.081 microg L(-1) forNVPand NMP, respectively. Relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) for five replications of analyses was found to be less than 6.0%. In real samples the mean recoveries were 94.81% and 94.15% forNVPand NMP, respectively. The results demonstrated the suitability of the HS-SPME technique for analyzingNVPand NMP in two different pharmaceutical matrices. In addition, the method was used for simultaneous detection ofNVP, 2-pyrrolidone(2-Pyr), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and ethanolamine (EA) compounds.",

Poly (methacrylic acid)-chitosan (PMC) and poly(methacrylic acid-vinylpyrrolidone)-chitosan (PMVC) microparticles were prepared by an ionic-gelation method. Mucoadhesion behaviour of these particles was evaluated by ex-vivo adhesion method using freshly excised rat intestinal tissue. Cytotoxicity and absorption enhancing property of PMC and PMVC particles were evaluated on Caco 2 cell monolayers. Protease enzyme inhibition capability and insulin loading/release properties of these hydrogel particles was evaluated under in vitro experimental conditions. Addition ofNVPunits enhanced the mucoadhesion behavior of PMC particles on isolated rat intestinal tissue. Both PMC and PMVC particles were found non-toxic on Caco 2 cell monolayers and PMC particles was more effective in improving paracellular transport of fluorescent dextran across Caco 2 cell monolayers as compared to PMVC particles. However, protease inhibition efficacy of PMC particles was not significantly affected withNVPaddition.NVPincorporation improved the insulin release properties of PMC microparticles at acidic pH. Hydrophilic modification seems to be an interesting approach in improving mucoadhesion capability of PMC microparticles.",

p,"The surface properties of intravenously injected nanoparticles determine the acquired blood protein adsorption pattern and subsequently the organ distribution and cellular recognition. A series of poly[acrylonitrile-co-(N-vinylpyrrolidone)] (PANcoNVP) model nanoparticles (133-181 nm) was synthesized, in which the surface properties were altered by changing the molar content ofNVP(0-33.8 mol%) as the more hydrophilic repeating unit. The extent of achieved surface property variation was comprehensively characterized. The residual sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) content from the synthesis was in the range 0.3-1.6 μgml(-1), potentially contributing to the surface properties. Surface hydrophobicity was determined by Rose Bengal dye adsorption, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and aqueous two-phase partitioning (TPP). Particle charge was quantified by zeta potential (ZP) measurements including ZP-pH profiles. The interaction with proteins was analyzed by ZP measurements in serum and by adsorption studies with single proteins. Compared to hydrophobic polystyrene model nanoparticles, all PANcoNVPparticles were very hydrophilic. Differences in surface hydrophobicity could be detected, which did not linearly correlate with the systematically altered bulk composition of the PANcoNVPnanoparticles. This proves the high importance of a thorough surface characterization applying a full spectrum of methods, complementing predictions solely based on bulk polymer composition. Copyright © 2015.

p,"The incorporation of two different monomers, having different properties, in the same polymer molecule leads to the formation of new materials with great scientific and commercial importance. The basic requirements for polymeric materials in some areas of biomedical applications are that they are hydrophilic, having good mechanical and thermal properties, soft, and oxygen-permeable. A series of 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate/N-vinylpyrrolidone(TMSPM/NVP) xerogels containing different concentration of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as crosslinking agent were prepared by bulk polymerization to high conversion using BPO as initiator. The copolymers were characterized by FTIR. The corresponding hydrogels were obtained by swelling the xerogels in deionized water to equilibrium. Addition of EGDMA increases the transparency of xerogels and hydrogels. The minimum amount of EGDMA required to produce a transparent xerogel is 1%. All the Swelling parameters, including water content (EWC), volume fraction of polymer (ϕ 2 ) and weight loss during swelling decrease with increasing EGDMA. Young's and shear modulus (E and G) increase as EGDMA increases. The hydrogels were characterized in terms of modulus cross-linking density (v e and v t ) and polymer-solvent interaction parameters (χ). Thermal properties include TGA and glass transition temperature (T g ) enhance by adding EGDMA whereas the oxygen permeability (P) of hydrogels decreases as water content decrease. This study prepared and studied the properties for new copolymer (TMSPM-co-NVP) contains different amounts of (EGDMA). These copolymers possess new properties with potential use in different biomedical applications. The properties of the prepared hydrogels are fit with the standard properties of materials which should be used for contact lenses.",

p,"The degradation routes of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) exposed to sodium hypochlorite (bleach) have been previously investigated using chemical analyses such as infrared spectroscopy. So far, no reports have proposed mass spectrometry (MS) as an alternative tool despite its capability to provide molecular and structural information using its single stage electrospray (ESI) or matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and multi stage (MSn) configurations, respectively. The present study thus reports on the characterization of PVP after its exposure to bleach by high resolution MALDI spiralTOF-MS and Kendrick mass defect analysis providing clues as to the formation of avinylpyrrolidone/vinylsuccinimide copolymeric degradation product. A thorough investigation of the fragmentation pathways of PVP adducted with sodium and proton allows one main route to be described—namely the release of thepyrrolidonependant group in a charge remote and charge driven mechanism, respectively. Extrapolating this fragmentation pathway, the oxidation ofvinylpyrrolidoneintovinylsuccinimide hypothesized from the single stage MS is validated by the detection of an alternative succinimide neutral loss in lieu of thepyrrolidonerelease in the ESI-MSn spectra of the aged PVP sample. It constitutes an example of application of multi-stage mass spectrometry for the characterization of the degradation of polymeric samples at a molecular level. PMID:27800293",

The magnetic poly(GMA-MBAA-NVP) microspheres were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and so on. The results showed that poly(GMA-MBAA-NVP) microspheres possessed well spherical shape, narrow size distribution, abundant porous structure, reactive oxirane groups and superparamagnetic properties. Formamide used in the present work served as a modifier, a dispersant and a porogen to form final porous polymer microspheres. The penicillin G acylase (PGA) was covalently immobilized onto the magnetic microspheres through the reaction between the amino groups of enzyme and the oxirane groups on the microspheres for producing 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA). The effects of GMA/NVPratio and crosslink density on the activity of immobilized PGA were investigated. The highest apparent activity, enzyme loading and coupling yield of immobilized PGA were 821 IU/g, 65.3 mg/g and 42.3% respectively when the mass ratio of GMA/NVPwas 1:1 and crosslink density was 60%. Compared with the free PGA, immobilized PGA showed a wider range of pH value and reaction temperature. The relative activity and reaction rate of immobilized PGA remained almost constant after 20 recycles. The magnetic poly(GMA-MBAA-NVP) microspheres would be very promising carriers for immobilizing enzymes in industrial application.",

p,"New generation polyamine inhibitors are amino-terminated polyethers with excellent inhibiting capabilities; they play a key role in borehole stabilization and reservoir protection. However, polyamine inhibitors are limited by their poor thermal stability, which can be attributed to the presence of ether bonds in their molecular structures. We propose a three-step synthesis approach fora novelpyrrolidone-containing polyamine inhibitor (DYNP) by introducingN-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone(NVP) on divinyloxyethane. This polyamine inhibitor exhibits an optimized molecular structure and has enhanced heat resistance. Characterizations by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and evaluation tests demonstrate several advantages of DYNP inhibitors, including excellent inhibiting capability (superior to similar materials such as polyamines), improved heat resistance (reasonable stability at temperatures up to 240°C), and good compatibility with both fresh water and salt water drilling fluids. These can be attributed to the presence of considerable amounts of amino groups in the repeating unit of DYNP molecules. The DYNP inhibitor was applied in over 20 boreholes in tight oil blocks in Daqing Oilfield to relieve hydration of formations with high shale contents. For instance, drilling in the 2033.5m horizontal section of Dragon 2 borehole was smooth, with a borehole diameter expansion ratio below 10%.",

p,"Knowledge on the solubility behaviour and dissolution rate of speciality and commodity polymers is very important for the use of such materials in high-tech applications. We have developed methods for the quantification and characterization of dissolved copolymers ofN-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone(VP) andvinylacetate (VA) during dissolution in water. The methods are based on pyrolysis (Py) performed in a programmed-temperature vaporization injector with subsequent identification and quantification of the components in the pyrolysate using capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). By injecting large volumes and applying cryo-focussing at the top of the column, low detection limits could be achieved. The monomer ratio was found to have the greatest effect on the dissolution rate of the PVP-co-VA copolymers. The material with the highest amount of VA (50%) dissolves significantly slower than the other grades. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and Py-GC-MS were used to measure molecular weights and average chemical compositions, respectively. Combined off-line SEC//Py-GC-MS was used to determine the copolymer composition (VP/VA ratio), as a function of the molecular weight for the pure polymers. In the dissolution experiments, a constant VP/VA ratio across the dissolution curve was observed for all copolymers analysed. This suggests a random distribution of the two monomers over the molecules. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

For this purpose, hydrogen peroxide/ascorbic acid redox pair was employed as water-soluble and biocompatible initiator system. FT-IR spectra confirmed the insertion of MAA onto the polymeric chain. Stability studies, performed under various conditions, such as freeze-thaw cycles, exposure to strong light, thermal stability studies under constant humidity and with light protection at different temperatures, showed the preservative properties of the polymeric material towards flavonoids. Furthermore, the biocompatibility was highlighted by Hen's Egg Test-Chorioallantoic Membrane assay and in vitro release studies demonstrated the possibility to employ PVP-MAA copolymer as a device for gastro-intestinal release of flavonoids.

Silver release kinetics and mechanical properties of nanocomposites were investigated under bioreactor conditions in the simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37°C. The release of silver was monitored under static conditions, and in two types of bioreactors: perfusion bioreactors and a bioreactor with dynamic compression coupled with SBF perfusion simulating in vivo conditions in articular cartilage. Ag/PVP nanocomposites exhibited slight cytotoxic effects against PBMC at the estimated concentration of 0.4 μmol dm(-3), with negligible variations observed amongst different cell cultures investigated. Studies of the silver release kinetics indicated internal diffusion as the rate limiting step, determined by statistically comparable results obtained at all investigated conditions. However, silver release rate was slightly higher in the bioreactor with dynamic compression coupled with SBF perfusion as compared to the other two systems indicating the influence of dynamic compression. Modelling of silver release kinetics revealed potentials for optimization of Ag/PVP nanocomposites for particular applications as wound dressings or soft tissue implants.

The resulting Au:PVP clusters were subsequently used as catalysts for a kinetic study on the sized-dependent aerobic oxidation of 1-indanol, which was monitored by time-resolved in situ infrared spectroscopy. The obtained results suggest that the catalytic behaviour is intimately correlated to the size of the clusters, which in turn depends on the molecular weight of the PVPs. The highest catalytic activity was observed for clusters with a core size of ~7 nm, and the size of the cluster should increase with the molecular weight of the polymer in order to maintain optimal catalytic activity. Studies on the electronic and colloid structure of these clusters revealed that the negative charge density on the cluster surface also strongly depends on the molecular weight of the stabilizing polymers.",

Thermal stability of electrospun composite fibers was decreased with the addition of CNCs. The CNCs help increase the composite tensile strength, while the elongation at break decreased. The composite fibers included Ag nanoparticles showed improved antimicrobial activity against both the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) and the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The enhanced strength and antimicrobial performances of PVP/CNC/Ag electrospun composite fibers make the mat material an attractive candidate for application in the biomedical field. PMID:28773644",

The pH-responsive behavior of the hydrogels is confirmed under equilibrium and dynamic conditions, with the hydrogel collapsed at acidic pH and swollen at neutral pH. The ability of the hydrogels to partition model protein therapeutics at varying pH and ionic strength is evaluated using three model proteins: insulin, porcine growth hormone, and ovalbumin.

p,"Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and its copolymers have been widely employed for the modification of hemodiafiltration membranes due to their excellent hydrophilicity, antifouling and hemocompatibility. However, challenges still remain to simplify the modification procedure and to improve the utilization efficiency. In this paper, antifouling and hemocompatibility polysulfone (PSf) hemodiafiltration membranes were fabricated via in situ cross-linked polymerization ofvinylpyrrolidone(VP) and vinyltriethoxysilane (VTEOS) in PSf solutions and non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) technique. The prepared membranes were characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which suggested that VP and VTEOS have been cross-linked copolymerized in PSf membranes. The modified PSf membranes with high polymer content showed improved hydrophilicity, ultrafiltration and protein antifouling ability. In addition, the modified PSf membranes showed lower protein adsorption, inhibited platelet adhesion and deformation, prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and decreased the content of fibrinogen (FIB) transferring to fibrin, indicating enhanced hemocompatibility. In a word, the present work provides a simple and effective one-step modification method to construct PSf membranes with improved hydrophilicity, antifouling and hemocompatibility.

We analyzedNVPresistance in HIV-infected Ugandan infants who received either SDNVPor extendedNVPprophylaxis. We tested plasma HIV by using a genotyping assay (ViroSeq; Celera Diagnostics), a phenotypic resistance assay (PhenoSense; Monogram Biosciences), and sensitive point mutation assay (LigAmp, for K103N, Y181C, and G190A). When infants were 6 weeks old, ViroSeq detectedNVPresistance in a higher proportion of infants in the extendedNVParm than in the SDNVParm (21 of 25 [84%] vs. 12 of 24 [50%]; P = .01). Similar results were obtained with LigAmp and PhenoSense. In both study arms, infants who were HIV infected at birth frequently hadNVPresistance detected. In contrast, infants in the extendedNVParm who were HIV infected after birth were more likely to have resistance detected at 6 weeks, compared with infants in the SDNVParm. The use of extendedNVPprophylaxis was also associated with detection ofNVPresistance by ViroSeq at 6 months (7 of 7 [100%] infants in the extendedNVParm had resistance detected, compared with 1 of 6 [16.7%] infants in the SDNVParm; P = .005). The use of extendedNVPprophylaxis was associated with increased selection for and persistence ofNVPresistance in HIV-infected Ugandan infants.",

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis showed that the hydrophilic branched chains (NVP-g-PEGMA) were successfully grafted to polypropylene (PP) macromolecular chains. The largestNVPgrafting degree for PP-g-(NVP-co-PEGMA) (up to 20.4%) was obtained when the mass ratio of PP/NVP/PEGMA was 100/30/15. Hydrophilic PP microporous membranes were prepared by stretching cast films of PP/PP-g-(NVP-co-PEGMA) blends. The membrane thermostability (including the modifier) was better than that of the pure PP membrane with a similar surface pore structure. The porosity of the modified membranes was only slightly lower than that of the pure PP membranes. Contact angle measurements were used to examine the hydrophilicity of the membranes. The water contact angle of the membranes decreased when PP-g-(NVP-co-PEGMA) was added, and the minimum contact angle was 64.5°.

This study investigates exposure toN-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone(NEP) in varnishing of hard plastic components in an automobile plant. Two specific biomarkers of exposure, 5-hydroxy-N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone(5-HNEP) and 2-hydroxy-N-ethylsuccinimide (2-HESI), were analyzed in urine samples of 14 workers. For this purpose, pre-shift, post-shift and next day pre-shift urine samples were collected midweek. Twelve workers performed regular work tasks (loading, wiping and packing), whereas two workers performed special work tasks including cleaning the sprayer system with organic solvents containingN-alkyl-2-pyrrolidones. Spot urine samples of nine non-exposed persons of the same plant served as controls. Median post-shift urinary levels of workers with regular work tasks (5-HNEP: 0.15 mg/L; 2-HESI: 0.19 mg/L) were ∼5-fold higher compared to the controls (0.03 mg/L each). Continuously increasing metabolite levels, from pre-shift via post-shift to pre-shift samples of the following day, were observed in particular for the two workers with the special working tasks. Maximum levels were 31.01 mg/L (5-HNEP) and 8.45 mg/L (2-HESI). No clear trend was evident for workers with regular working tasks. In summary, we were able to show that workers can be exposed to NEP during varnishing tasks in the automobile industry. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A strong surface plasmon resonance band at 529 nm in the UV-Visible spectrum confirms the formation of GNPs in the Au colloid. The FTIR spectroscopic results showed that PVP molecules get chemisorbed onto the surface of GNP via O-atom of carbonyl group. A negative zeta potential of (-)16 mV reveals accumulation of nonbonding electrons of O-atom of carbonyl group of PVP molecules on the nanosurface of GNP. TEM images demonstrate a core-shell nanostructure with an Au-crystalline core covered by a thin amorphous PVP-shell.

Poly(acrylic acid (AA)-co-itaconic acid (IA)-co-N-vinylpyrrolidone) was synthesized by free radical polymerization. The terpolymer was characterized using (1)H NMR, FTIR spectroscopy and viscometry for solution properties. The synthesized polymers were used in glass ionomer cement formulations (Fuji II commercial GIC). Surface properties (wettability) of modified cements were studied by water contact angle measurements as a function of time. Work of adhesion values of different surfaces was also determined. The effect ofNVPmodified polyacid, on bond strength of glass-ionomer cement to dentin was also investigated. The mean data obtained from contact angle and bonding strength measurements were subjected to one- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at alpha=0.05. Results showed thatNVPmodified glass ionomer cements showed significantly lower contact angles (theta=47 degrees) and higher work of adhesion (WA=59.4 erg/cm(2)) in comparison to commercially available Fuji II GIC (theta=60 degrees and WA=50.3 erg/cm(2), respectively).

It is appropriate to take the pregnancy-related versus nonpregnancy-related approach when determining the cause of nausea and vomiting but other causes should be considered. The most common etiologies forNVPinclude the hormonal changes associated with pregnancy, the physiologic changes in the gastrointestinal tract, and a genetic predisposition. Up to 10% of women will require pharmacotherapy to treat the symptoms ofNVPdespite conservative measures. ACOG currently recommends that a combination of oral pyridoxine hydrochloride and doxylamine succinate be used as first-line treatment forNVPif pyridoxine monotherapy does not relieve symptoms. A review ofNVPand early pharmacotherapeutic management is presented due to the fact thatNVPis largely undertreated, and investigations into the safe and effective pharmacotherapies available to treatNVPare lacking.

Flooding tests carried out through linear-dimensional sandstone model at simulated reservoir conditions, and recovered oil amount calculated on volumetric basis.

p,"Pyrrolidoncarboxypeptidase is an omega-peptidase that hydrolysesN-terminal pyroglutamyl residues from biologically active peptides such as gonadotropin-releasing and thyrotrophin-releasing hormones. We previously described a decrease in both rat and humanpyrrolidoncarboxypeptidase activity with breast cancer, suggesting that gonadotropin-releasing hormone may be an important local intracrine, autocrine and/or paracrine hormonal factor in the pathogenesis of breast cancer while playing a role in the tumoral process. However, the other susceptible substrate ofpyrrolidoncarboxypeptidase, thyrotrophin-releasing hormone, may also be modified with breast cancer, supporting an association between breast cancer and thyroid disorders. The present work analyses soluble and membrane-boundpyrrolidoncarboxypeptidase activities in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid and hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axes inN-methyl nitrosourea-induced breast cancer in rats. Our aim was to determine the possible relationship between gonadotropin-releasing hormone and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone regulation throughpyrrolidoncarboxypeptidase activity. We propose thatpyrrolidoncarboxypeptidase activity dysregulation at various local and systemic levels may participate in the initiation, promotion and progression of breast cancer induced in rat byN-methyl nitrosourea through the increase in gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Sincepyrrolidoncarboxypeptidase activity also acts on thyrotrophin-releasing hormone, the dysregulation of this enzyme's activity could indirectly affect hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis function, and thus potentially represent a link between the diseases of thyroid and breast cancer.",

With 2 μg of the tryptic digests of IgG as the sample, after enrichment, 18 glycopeptides could be identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis. Furthermore, with the mixture of BSA and IgG digests (10,000:1, m/m) as the sample, 6N-linked glycopeptides were unambiguously identified after enrichment, indicating the high selectivity and good specificity of such material. Moreover, such a monolithic capillary column was also applied for theN-glycosylation sites profiling of 6 μg protein digests from HeLa cells and 1 μL human serum. In total, 530 and 262 uniqueN-glycosylated peptides were identified, respectively, corresponding to 282 and 124N-glycoproteins, demonstrating its great potential for the large scale glycoproteomics analysis.

It is well-known that metal clusters with less than 2 nm size do not show the usual surface plasmon band, because of the presence of a band-gap at the fermi level. Nevertheless, our present oligomer coated gold clusters show a discrete intense band at around 630 nm, whichmore » could very well be attributed to the charge transfer between the oligomer chain and the surface Au atoms. Such kind of sacrificial plasmon induced charge transfer interaction, observed for the very first time to the best of our knowledge, were also strongly corroborated through the enhancement / shifting of specific vibrational / rotational peaks as observed from the FTIR and Raman measurements as a function of the metal oxidation states, thus representing a new prototype for an efficient solar energy conversion probe.« less",

Thus, the desire to synchronize both their properties for specific applications has naturally prompted research in the design and synthesis of core-shell type novel nanoAg@mesoSiO2 nanocomposites, which display potential utility in applications such as photothermal therapy, photocatalysis, molecular sensing, and photovoltaics. In the present work, SiO2 spheres were carefully functionalized with the monomer,N-vinylpyrrolidone(NVP), which cohesively controls the uniform mass transfer of Ag+ metal ions, thereby enabling its sequential reduction to zerovalent Ag (in the presence of slightly excess NaOH) by electron transfer from nucleophilic attack of theNVPvinylgroup by the water molecules even under ambient conditions. Complete metal nanoshell coverage of the silica surface was obtained after multiple Ag deposition cycles, as systematically confirmed from the BET, TEM, optical and FTIR characterization. Our present Ag-coated silica spheres were directly utilized as viable SERS substrates with high sensitivity in contrast with other long chain polymer/surfactant coated silica spheres, owing to the presence of significant number of nanogaps enhanced SERS 'hotspots', which were methodically analyzed utilizing two example analytes, such as crystal violet (CV) and calendula officinalis (CaF).",

Variation in crosslink density and surface hydrophilicity of X-HTPPF are observed due to non-stoichiometric mass of reacting partners. These variations influence absorption of the medium and biodegradation during aging. Though the initial absorption of medium is relatively higher with the crosslinked polymer (PNVP1) having 63.6% HT-PPF and 36.4% comonomern-vinylpyrrolidone(NVP) during the initial period of aging, the weight loss due to subsequent degradation with time is relatively lesser. PNVP1 undergo slow degradation with formation of fibril structure on the surface. The present crosslinked material PNVP1 is a candidate for the load bearing orthopedic applications.",

At first, one-dimensional α-MnO 2 nanorods (NRs) were produced by a hydrothermal technique and then they were amended with stearic acid (SA) by a solvothermal process. In following, the NCs were made by adding different volumes of α-MnO 2 -SA NR (1, 3 and 5wt%) in the PVP matrix through ultrasonic irradiation as a green, low-cost, fast, and useful technique. Structural and morphological descriptions confirm crystallinity of α-MnO 2 -SA NRs and showed that NRs have been separately dispersed in PVP matrix with rod-like morphology and diameter of about 40-60nm. The use of modifier and ultrasonic waves is accountable for good homogeneities of NRs. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that thermal permanency of the obtained NCs has grown with increasing the α-MnO 2 -SA content. Also, the UV-vis absorption of NCs was enhanced with the incorporation of the modified α-MnO 2 NR in PVP matrix. The substantial perfections in NCs properties are associated to compatible intermolecular relations between the surface modifying groups of the α-MnO 2 -SA and PVP chain.

p,"There has been generally little attention paid to the utilization of biomaterials as an anti-myopia treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether polymeric hydrogels, either implanted or injected adjacent to the outer scleral surface, slow ocular elongation. White Leghorn (gallus gallus domesticus) chicks were used at 2 weeks of age. Chicks had either (1) strip of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) implanted monocularly against the outer sclera at the posterior pole, or (2) an in situ polymerizing gel [main ingredient: poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone) (PVP)] injected monocularly at the same location. Some of the eyes injected with the polymer were fitted with a diffuser or a −10D lens. In each experiment, ocular lengths were measured at regular intervals by high frequency A-scan ultrasonography, and chicks were sacrificed for histology at staged intervals. No in vivo signs of either orbital or ocular inflammation were observed. The pHEMA implant significantly increased scleral thickness by the third week, and the implant became encapsulated with fibrous tissue. The PVP-injected eyes left otherwise untreated, showed a significant increase in scleral thickness, due to increased chondrocyte proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. However, there was no effect of the PVP injection on ocular elongation. In eyes wearing optical devices, there was no effect on either scleral thickness or ocular elongation. These results represent “proof of principle” that scleral growth can be manipulated without adverse inflammatory responses. However, since neither approach slowed ocular elongation, additional factors must influence scleral surface area expansion in the avian eye. PMID:19109950",

It is used in a wide variety of pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food industrial or technical applications and produced on an industrial scale. Since VP has caused adenocarcinoma of the nasal cavity and liver cell carcinoma in long-term experiments with rats, a human biomarker would be appreciated for risk assessment. A sensitive analytical electron ionization gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) method for the determination of six possible biomarkers for VP in urine was established and validated. Two isotope-labeled internal standards (ISTD) were used for quantification. A simple and easy to use freeze-drying step was performed prior to derivatization withN-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoracetamide (MTBSTFA) and following sample extraction for cleanup purposes. A calibration curve with six calibration standards ranging from 50 μg/L to 2000 μg/L (10-fold higher for H-OPAA) in urine was prepared. Validation results were satisfactory with recoveries ranging from 88.2 to 110.2 % with two exceptions for the lowest quality control for two substances without ISTD (126.4 % and 139.3 %). Three of the substances could be identified as VP metabolites in an exposure study with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. A quick and easy to use method has been established for six target molecules investigated for a better understanding of the metabolism of VP. Two of three substances identified as metabolites of VP could serve as a nonspecific human biomarker for VP exposure as shown with an excerpt of an exposure study performed in SD rats.

Particle size showed no significant effect on overall delivery potential but did improve percent release of encapsulated protein over the micro-scale particle size range studied. Protein size was shown to have a significant impact on the delivery capability of the P(IA-co-NVP) hydrogel. We show that when using P(IA-co-NVP) hydrogel microparticles with 3 mol% tetra(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate crosslinker, a small polypeptide (salmon calcitonin) loads and releases up to 45 μg/mg hydrogel while the mid-sized protein urokinase and large monoclonal antibody rituximab load and release only 19 and 24 μg/mg hydrogel, respectively. We further demonstrate that crosslinking density offers a simple method for tuning hydrogel properties to variously sized proteins. Using 5 mol% TEGDMA crosslinker offers optimal performance for the small peptide, salmon calcitonin, whereas lower crosslinking density of 1 mol% offers optimal performance for the much larger protein rituximab. Finally, an enzymatically-degradable hydrogels of P(MAA-co-NVP) crosslinked with the peptide sequence MMRRRKK were synthesized and tested in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions. These hydrogels offer ideal loading and release behavior, showing no degradative release of encapsulated salmon calcitonin in gastric conditions while yielding rapid and complete release of encapsulated protein within 1h in intestinal conditions.

The effect of monomer concentration, solvent and EPDM structural factors on the grafting behavior have been investigated. The inhibitory effect upon homopolymerization of various salts has also been evaluated for the three monomers.NVPand HEMA could be grafted onto EPDM rubber in the presence of aqueous solutions of cupric nitrate at 0.005 M and 1.0 M concentrations respectively. Aqueous solutions of Mohr's salt (ammonium ferrous sulphate) at 0.05 M not only suppressed the homopolymerization of AAm but also increased grafting yield. The percentage grafting also increased with increasing AAm concentration. A mechanism has been proposed to explain the behaviour of these monomers. The inclusion of multifunctional acrylates in additive amounts (1.0 vol%) enhanced the graft degree. Modified samples were able to be efficiently stained, allowing the depth of the graft copolymerization to be determined by light microscopy. Water was found to have an accelerating effect on the polymerization of these monomers, but methanol prevented their polymerization completely. The effect of EPDM structural factors upon degree of grafting was found to vary, depending upon the monomer type.",

Transmittance, water uptake, swelling, microstructure, drug absorption isotherms and in vitro release were characterized using triamcinolone acetonide (TA) as model drug. Best drug loading ratios were obtained with lenses containing the highest amount (200 mM) of MA. Incorporation of 40% V/V of water during the polymerization increases the hydrogel porosity giving a better drug loading capacity. In vitro TA release kinetics shows that MA hydrogels released the drug significantly faster thanNVP-hydrogels. Drug release was found to be diffusion controlled and kinetics was shown to be reproducible after consecutive drug loading/release processes. Results of p(HEMA) based soft contact lenses copolymerized with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and different co-monomers could be a good alternative to optimize the loading and ocular drug delivery of this corticosteroid drug.

p,"1-Methyl-pyrrolidone(NMP) is used as a solvent in many technical applications. The general population may be exposed to NMP from the use as ingredient in paint and graffiti remover, indoors also from use in paints and carpeting. Because of developmental toxic effects, the use of NMP in consumer products in the EU is regulated. The developmental effects accompanied by weak maternally toxic effects in animal experiments are considered as the critical effects by the German HBM Commission. Based on these effects, HBM-I values of 10 mg/l urine for children and of 15 mg/l for adults, respectively, were derived for the metabolites 5-Hydroxy-NMP and 2-Hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide. HBM-II-values were set to 30 mg/l urine for children and 50 mg/l for adults, respectively. Because of similar effects of the structural analogue 1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone(NEP), the possible mixed exposure to both compounds has to be taken into account when evaluating the total burden.",

This study reports current exposures to NMP in the spraying department of an automobile plant using biological monitoring. Two specific metabolites, 5-hydroxy-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone(5-HNMP) and 2-hydroxy-N-methyl-succinimide (2-HMSI), were analyzed in 69 urine samples of 14 workers exposed to NMP and 9 nonexposed controls. Three different working tasks ('loading' and 'cleaning' of the sprayer system and 'wiping/packing' of the sprayed materials) and three sampling times (preshift, postshift, and preshift of the following day) were studied in exposed workers. Median exposures of 5-HNMP and 2-HMSI in postshift urine of exposed workers were 0.91 and 0.52mg g(-1) creatinine, respectively, whereas median levels in controls were below the limit of detection. Decreased levels of 5-HNMP were observed in preshift urine samples on the following day (0.39mg g(-1) creatinine) in exposed workers, while the concentration of 2-HMSI did not change (0.49mg g(-1) creatinine). Highest exposures occurred during sprayer cleaning with a maximum level of 8.31mg g(-1) creatinine of 5-HNMP in postshift urine. In contrast to 'wipers/packers', no decrease in 5-HNMP could be observed in preshift urine samples on day 2 of the 'loaders' and 'cleaners'. Overall, exposure in terms of 5-HNMP postshift and 2-HMSI preshift of the following day were well below the current biological limit values of the European Union (70 and 20mg g(-1) creatinine). Our results provide initial data on NMP exposure in the automobile industry and suggest that the analysis of 5-HNMP in preshift samples also provides essential information, particularly in situations involving direct handling of liquid NMP-containing formulations.",

p,"HSP90 is a molecular chaperone essential for stability, activity and intracellular sorting of many proteins, including oncoproteins, such as tyrosine kinases, transcription factors and cell cycle regulatory proteins. Therefore, inhibitors of HSP90 are being investigated for their potential as anti-cancer drugs. Here we show that the HSP90 inhibitorNVP-AUY922 induced degradation of the fusion oncoprotein FOP2-FGFR1 in a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line, KG-1a. Concordantly, downstream signaling cascades, such as STAT1, STAT3 and PLCγ were abrogated. At concentrations that caused FOP2-FGFR1 degradation and signaling abrogation,NVP-AUY922 treatment caused significant cell death and inhibition of proliferation of KG-1a cells in vitro. In an animal model for AML,NVP-AUY922 administrated alone showed no anti-leukemic activity. However, whenNVP-AUY922 was administered in combination with cytarabine, the two compounds showed significant synergistic anti-leukemic activity in vivo. ThusNVP-AUY922 and cytarabine combination therapy might be a prospective strategy for AML treatment. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Urinary concentrations of NMP and its known metabolites 5-hydoxy-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone(5-HNMP),N-methyl-succinimide (MSI), and 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide (2-HMSI) were determined in a single run. The method provided baseline separation of these compounds. Their limits of detection in 10-fold diluted urine were 0.0001, 0.006, 0.008, and 0.03 mg/L, respectively. Linear calibration covered a biological exposure index (BEI) for urinary concentration. The within-run and total precisions (CV, %) were 5.6% and 9.2% for NMP, 3.4% and 4.2% for 5-HNMP, 3.7% and 6.0% for MSI, and 6.5% and 6.9% for 2-HMSI. The method was evaluated using international external quality assessment samples, and urine samples from workers exposed to NMP in an occupational area.",

Additionally, the remaining NMP in the pads was determined to estimate the total dermal uptake. The concentration of NMP in urine increased rapidly after beginning of the exposure up to 1 h after the exposure was completed. A peak concentration of 1,836+/-863 microg/l was observed, the half-life in urine was 3.2 h. About 0.5% of the absorbed dose was excreted metabolically unchanged. An average dermal absorption of 5.5 mg cm(-2) h(-1) was calculated. The results of this study show that the percutaneous absorption of NMP may contribute significantly to the overall uptake of the solvent, e.g. in the workplace.

Developing strategies for the asymmetric synthesis ofvinyl-ACCA is thus extremely high demand. In this study, 378 bacterial strains were isolated from soil samples usingN-Boc-vinyl-ACCA ethyl ester as the sole carbon source and were screened for esterase activity. Fourteen of which worked effectively for the asymmetric synthesis of (1R, 2S)-N-Boc-1-vinylACCA ethyl ester. The strain CY-2, identified as Sphingomonas aquatilis, which showed the highest stability and enantioselectivity was selected as whole cell biocatalyst for further study. A systematic study of all factors influencing the enzymatic hydrolysis was performed. Under optimized conditions, resolution of rac-vinyl-ACCA to (1R, 2S)-N-Boc-1-vinylACCA ethyl ester with 88.2% ee and 62.4% conversion (E = 9) was achieved.

However, the dose of amiloride is limited by the mechanism-based side effect of hyperkalaemia resulting from renal ENaC blockade. Inhaled ENaC blockers with a reduced potential to induce hyperkalaemia provide a therapeutic strategy to improve mucosal hydration and MCC in the lungs of CF patients. The present study describes the preclinical profile of a novel ENaC blocker,NVP-QBE170, designed for inhaled delivery, with a reduced potential to induce hyperkalaemia. Experimental Approach The in vitro potency and duration of action ofNVP-QBE170 were compared with amiloride and a newer ENaC blocker, P552-02, in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) by short-circuit current. In vivo efficacy and safety were assessed in guinea pig (tracheal potential difference/hyperkalaemia), rat (hyperkalaemia) and sheep (MCC). Key Results In vitro,NVP-QBE170 potently inhibited ENaC function in HBEC and showed a longer duration of action to comparator molecules. In vivo, intratracheal (i.t.) instillation ofNVP-QBE170 attenuated ENaC activity in the guinea pig airways with greater potency and duration of action than that of amiloride without inducing hyperkalaemia in either guinea pig or rat. Dry powder inhalation ofNVP-QBE170 by conscious sheep increased MCC and was better than inhaled hypertonic saline in terms of efficacy and duration of action. Conclusions and ImplicationsNVP-QBE170 highlights the potential for inhaled ENaC blockers to exhibit efficacy in the airways with a reduced risk of hyperkalaemia, relative to existing compounds.

Dry powder inhalation ofNVP-QBE170 by conscious sheep increased MCC and was better than inhaled hypertonic saline in terms of efficacy and duration of action.NVP-QBE170 highlights the potential for inhaled ENaC blockers to exhibit efficacy in the airways with a reduced risk of hyperkalaemia, relative to existing compounds. © 2015 The British Pharmacological Society.",

The pharmacokinetics ofpyrrolidonemonitored upon its combined administration with pyroglutamic acid shows that this drug, as a component of the composition, is characterized by a high absolute bioavailability and permeability trough the blood-brain barrier. The presence of pyroglutamic acid slows down the absorption and elimination ofpyrrolidoneand enhances its distribution in the organs and tissues. There is a correlation between the concentration ofpyrrolidonein the brain, on the one hand, and the levels of cerebral microcirculation and arterial pressure on the other hand. An increase in the concentration ofpyrrolidonein the brain is accompanied by more intensive cerebral blood flow and by a decrease in the arterial pressure.",

p,"Background This phase III randomized clinical trial compared single dose nevirapine (sdNVP) plus HIV immunoglobulin (HIVIGLOB) to sdNVPalone for preventing maternal-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. Primary objectives were to determine rates of HIV infection among infants, and to assess the safety of HIVIGLOB in combination with sdNVPin HIV-infected Ugandan pregnant women and their infants. Methods Mother-infant pairs were randomized to receive 200mg ofNVPto women in labor and 2mg/kgNVPto newborns within 72 hours after birth (sdNVParm) or to receive sdNVPplus a single intravenous 240ml dose of HIVIGLOB given to women at 36-38 weeks gestation and a single intravenous 24ml dose to newborns within 18 hours of birth (HIVIGLOB/sdNVParm). Risk of HIV infection was determined using Kaplan-Meier and risk ratio estimates at birth, 2, 6, 14 weeks, 6 and 12 months of age. Results Intent-to-treat analysis included 198 HIVIGLOB/sdNVPand 294 sdNVPmother-infant pairs. At 6 months of age, the primary endpoint, there was no statistically significant difference in HIV transmission in the HIVIGLOB/sdNVParm versus the sdNVParm (18.7% vs.15.0%; RR =1.240 [95% CI: 0.833-1.846]; p= 0.290). Similarly, the proportion of serious adverse events in the HIVIGLOB/sdNVPand sdNVParms, respectively for mothers (18.9% vs. 19.3%; p= 0.91) and infants (62.6% vs. 59.5%; p=0.51), were not significantly different. Conclusion Giving mother-infant pairs an infusion of peripartum HIV hyperimmunoglobulin in addition to sdNVPfor PMTCT was as safe as sdNVPalone, but was no more effective than sdNVPalone in preventing HIV transmission.

Upon binding to albumin, free HY available to be transported through the membrane may be limited. Hence, formulations containing a biocompatible solvent,N-Methylpyrrolidone(NMP), have the potential to enhance HY delivery into solid tumors. At suitable concentrations, NMP and/or light irradiation did not produce antivascular damage. Hypericin-PDT effects showed to be HY and NMP concentrations-dependent. These findings indicate that NMP is a promising solvent and penetration enhancer for HY-PDT clinical applications.",

In this research, the floating drug delivery system of amoxicillin trihydrate encapsulated in floating chitosan-graft-poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) hydrogels containing CaCO3 and NaHCO3 as pore forming agents has been successfully prepared. Pore forming agents used was varied with the ratio of 10 to 25% pore forming agents to total mass of the used materials. The hydrogel were characterizedusing FTIR spectrophotometer and stereo microscope. As pore forming agents compositions increased, the porosity (%) and floating properties increased but followed by decrease in drug entrapment efficiency. Most of the floating hydrogels possessed floating ability longer than 180 min and the highest porosity was found in hydrogel containing 25% NaHCO3. Hydrogel containing CaCO3 showed sustained drug release profile than hydrogel containing NaHCO3. However, the optimum formulation was achieved at composition of 10% NaHCO3 with 57% of drug entrapped within the hydrogel and 43% drug released. The results of these studies show that NaHCO3 is an effective pore forming agents for chitosan-graft-poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) hydrogel preparation as compare to CaCO3.",

The extraction media of unreacted components, crosslinked nanocomposites and their degradation products between 1X-100X dilutions were examined for effects on viability and attachment employing two cell lines: NIH3T3 fibroblasts and MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts. The extraction media of unreacted PPF/NVPelicited acute dose-dependent cytotoxicity attributed to leaching of unreacted components into cell culture media. However, extraction media of crosslinked nanocomposites showed no dose dependent adverse effects. Further, all crosslinked nanocomposites showed high viability (78–100%), high cellular attachment (40–55%), and spreading that was confirmed by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. Degradation products of nanocomposites showed a mild dose-dependent cytotoxicity possibly due to acidic degradation components of PPF. In general, compared to PPF control, none of the nanocomposites showed significant differences in cellular response to the unreacted components, crosslinked nanocomposites and their degradation products. The initial minor cytotoxic response and lower cell attachment numbers were observed only for a few nanocomposite groups; these effects were absent at later time points for all PPF nanocomposites. The favorable cytocompatibility results for all the nanocomposites opens avenues for in vivo safety and efficacy studies for bone tissue engineering applications. PMID:25367032",

We also combined these compounds with a MAPK pathway inhibitor (PD98059 or UO126) in cell lines with K-Ras alterations (mutations or amplification). PTEN mutant cell lines without K-Ras alterations (n = 9) were more sensitive to both RAD001 andNVP-BEZ235 than were cell lines with K-Ras alterations (n = 4). Dose-dependent growth suppression was more drastically induced byNVP-BEZ235 than by RAD001 in the sensitive cell lines. G1 arrest was induced byNVP-BEZ235 in a dose-dependent manner. We observed in vivo antitumor activity of both RAD001 andNVP-BEZ235 in nude mice. The presence of a MEK inhibitor, PD98059 or UO126, sensitized the K-Ras mutant cells toNVP-BEZ235. Robust growth suppression byNVP-BEZ235 suggests that a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is a promising therapeutic for endometrial carcinomas. Our data suggest that mutational statuses of PTEN and K-Ras might be useful predictors of sensitivity toNVP-BEZ235 in certain endometrial carcinomas. PMID:22662154",

Data are lacking as to whether the original compound or one of its main metabolites is responsible for the toxic effects observed. Therefore, the relative embryotoxicity of the parent compound and its metabolites was evaluated using rat whole embryo culture (WEC) and the balb/c 3T3 cytotoxicity test. The resulting data were evaluated using two strategies; namely, one based on using all endpoints determined in the WEC and the other including endpoints from both the WECmore » and the cytotoxicity test. On basis of the first analysis, the substance with the highest embryotoxic potential is NMP, followed by 5-hydroxy-N-methyl-pyrrolidone(5-HNMP), 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide (2-HMSI) andN-methylsuccinimide (MSI). Specific dysmorphogeneses induced by NMP and 5-HNMP were aberrations in the head region of the embryos, abnormal development of the second visceral arches and open neural pores. The second evaluation strategy used only two endpoints of the WEC, i.e. the no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC{sub WEC}) and the lowest concentration leading to dysmorphogenesis in 100% of the cultured embryos (IC{sub MaxWEC}). In addition to these WEC endpoints the IC{sub 503T3} from the cytotoxicity test (balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts) was included in the evaluation scheme. These three endpoints were applied to a prediction model developed during a validation study of the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) allowing the classification of the embryotoxic potential of each compound into three classes (non-, weakly- and strongly embryotoxic). Consistent results from both evaluation strategies were observed, whereby NMP and its metabolites revealed a direct embryotoxic potential.

Sonochemical modification is shown to influence exfoliation of layered materials in NMP and the optical absorbance of the solvent in the dispersion. The emerging optical properties of the degraded solvent present challenges for spectroscopy of nanomaterial dispersions; most notably the possibility of observing solvent photoluminescence in the spectra of 2D materials such as MoS 2 , highlighting the need for stable solvents and exfoliation processes to minimise the influence of solvent degradation on the properties of liquid-exfoliated 2D materials.",

In this paper, novel biocompatible thermoresponsive poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)/clay nanocomposite (PVCL-Clay) hydrogels with macroporous structure and improved mechanical characteristics are developed for the first time. The macroporosity in the hydrogel is introduced by using Pickering emulsions as templates, which containN-vinylcaprolactam (VCL) monomer as dispersed phase and clay sheets as stabilizers at the interface. After polymerization, macropores are formed inside the hydrogels with the residual unreacted VCL droplets as templates. The three-dimensional PVCL polymer networks are cross-linked by the clay nanosheets. Due to the nanocomposite structure, the hydrogel exhibits better mechanical characteristics in comparison to the conventional PVCL hydrogels cross-linked byN,N'-methylene diacrylamide (BIS). The prepared PVCL-Clay hydrogel possesses remarkable temperature-responsive characteristics with a volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) around 35 °C, and provides a feasible platform for cell culture. With macroporous structure and good mechanical characteristics as well as flexible assembly performance, the proposed biocompatible thermoresponsive PVCL-Clay nanocomposite hydrogels are ideal material candidates for biomedical, analytical, and other applications such as entrapment of enzymes, cell culture, tissue engineering, and affinity and displacement chromatography.",

The incidence of malformed fetuses per litter and the number of litters with malformed fetuses were significantly increased at 500 and 750 mg kg(-1) day(-1). Malformations mainly consisted of edema, anal atresia with absent tail, cardiovascular defects and fused cervical arches. Ossification of skull bones and sternebrae was significantly reduced at 500 and 750 mg kg(-1) day(-1). The incidence of supernumerary ribs was significantly elevated at 250 mg kg(-1) day(-1) and higher doses.

p,"Constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) has been reported and in a mouse model, PI3K activation, together with MYC, cooperates in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) pathogenesis. We investigated the effects ofNVP-BKM120, a potent pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, in lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines. Effects ofNVP-BKM120 on cell viability, clonogenicity, apoptosis, cell cycle, cell signalling and autophagy were assessed in vitro on T-ALL (Jurkat and MOLT-4) and BL (Daudi and NAMALWA) cell lines.NVP-BKM120 treatment decreased cell viability and clonogenic growth in all tested cells. Moreover, the drug arrested cell cycling in association with a decrease in Cyclin B1 protein levels, and increased apoptosis. Immunoblotting analysis of cells treated with the drug revealed decreased phosphorylation, in a dose-dependent manner, of AKT, mTOR, P70S6K and 4EBP1, with stable total protein levels. Additionally, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in BAD phosphorylation, in association with augmented BAX:BCL2 ratio. Quantification of autophagy showed a dose-dependent increase in acidic vesicular organelles in all cells tested. In summary, our present study establishes thatNVP-BKM120 presents an effective antitumour activity against T-ALL and BL cell lines. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

p,"Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA) which can be metabolized by esterase. MMF has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for treatment of psoriasis patient with skin symptoms. However, it remains unclear whether MMF is efficiently effective to treat skin symptoms developed from psoriasis. The insufficient amount of MMF penetrating through the skin results in the treatment failure due to the difficulty in MMF penetration through the stratum corneum. Skin permeation enhancers such as eucalyptol (EUL) andN-methyl-2-pyrrolidone(NMP) potentially aid in increasing skin penetration. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a concentration ratio (% w/v) between two enhancers (EUL and NMP). The results showed that EUL enhanced MMF permeation with an enhancement ratio (ER) of 3.44 while NMP was not able to promote the penetration of MMF. Interestingly, the synergistic effect of the two enhancers was observed with a suitable ratio given that the ER was 8.21. EUL and NMP are promising enhancers for the development of MMF based skin product. PMID:27069715",

The nanorods were randomly and individually dispersed inside the P(PF-co-EG) network, and noticeably increased the thermal stability, hydrophilicity, degree of crystallinity, protein absorption capability as well as stiffness and strength of the matrix, whilst decreased its level of porosity and biodegradation rate. More importantly, the resulting nanocomposites retained adequate rigidity and strength after immersion in a simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37°C. They also exhibited biocide action against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; their antibacterial effect was strong under UV-light illumination whilst in dark conditions was only moderate. Further, they did not cause toxicity on human dermal fibroblasts. The friction coefficient and wear rate strongly decreased with increasing nanorod loading under both dry and SBF conditions; the greatest drops in SBF were about 18-fold and 13-fold, respectively, compared to those of the copolymer network. These novel biomaterials are good candidates to be applied in the field of soft-tissue engineering. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We report the high resolution (0.001 wn) FTIR spectrum of anti-vinylalcohol collected at the infrared beamline facility of the Australian Synchrotron.Vinylalcohol was produced via the pyrolysis of 2-chloroethanol at 900°C, and its far infrared spectrum reveals the presence of the strong νb{15} fundamental and hot band of anti-vinylalcohol.

An energetically beneficial zip-holder complex, built on multiple inter- and intrachain hydroxyl-hydroxyl bonds and an intrachain hydroxyl-acetyloxy bond, can be formed between twovinylalcohol sequences. As a result, multiblock copolymers reveal stronger degree of association that affects crystallinity, as well as various rheological and relaxation properties discussed in the literature. Macromolecular complexes in random copolymers are weak and tend to be destroyed in the presence of residual DMF solvent and adsorbed water. Nevertheless, a rather stable interchain quaternary complex can be formed that includesvinylalcohol andvinylacetate units and DMF and water molecules. For a single chain it is shown that an H-bond between neighboringvinylalcohol andvinylacetate monomer units mostly engages a carbonyl oxygen atom of thevinylacetate, if thevinylalcohol belongs to a short (<5 units) sequence, and an ether oxygen atom in the other case. On the whole, the quantum chemistry calculations shed much light on the origin of distinctions in the copolymer FTIR spectra, which may seem subtle when considered standalone.",

Subsequently, a conversion from TiO 2 nanofibers to TiNnanorods was employed by the nitridation treatment at 600˜1400 °C in ammonia atmosphere. A typical characteristic of the final products was that the pristine nanofibers were cut into nanorods. The conversion from TiO 2 to TiNwas realized when the nitridation temperature was above 800 °C. As-prepared nanorods were composed of TiNnano-crystallites and the average crystallite size gradually increased with the increase of the nitridation temperature. Electrochemical properties of TiNnanorods showed strong dependence on the nitridation temperature. The maximum value of the specific capacitance was obtained from the TiNnanorods prepared at 800 °C.",

Here, we report the biologic properties of the 2-aminothiazole derivativeNVP-BYL719, a selective inhibitor of PI3Kα and its most common oncogenic mutant forms. The compound selectivity combined with excellent drug-like properties translates to dose- and time-dependent inhibition of PI3Kα signaling in vivo, resulting in robust therapeutic efficacy and tolerability in PIK3CA-dependent tumors. Novel targeted therapeutics such asNVP-BYL719, designed to modulate aberrant functions elicited by cancer-specific genetic alterations upon which the disease depends, require well-defined patient stratification strategies in order to maximize their therapeutic impact and benefit for the patients. Here, we also describe the application of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia as a preclinical platform to refine the patient stratification strategy forNVP-BYL719 and found that PIK3CA mutation was the foremost positive predictor of sensitivity while revealing additional positive and negative associations such as PIK3CA amplification and PTEN mutation, respectively.

Therefore, these signaling pathways are targets for inducing cancer cell death. The dual PI3K/Akt and mTOR inhibitorNVP-BEZ235 completely inhibited both signaling pathways. However,NVP-BEZ235 had no effect on cell death in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. We tested whether combined treatment with natural compounds andNVP-BEZ235 could induce cell death. Among several chemopreventive agents, curcumin, a natural biologically active compound that is extracted from the rhizomes of Curcuma species, markedly induced apoptosis inNVP-BEZ235-treated cells. Co-treatment with curcumin andNVP-BEZ235 led to the down-regulation of Mcl-1 protein expression but not mRNA expression. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 completely inhibited curcumin plusNVP-NEZ235-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the down-regulation of Bcl-2 was involved in curcumin plusNVP-BEZ235-induced apoptosis. Curcumin orNVP-BEZ235 alone did not change Bcl-2 mRNA or protein expression, but co-treatment reduced Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression. Combined treatment withNVP-BEZ235 and curcumin reduced Bcl-2 expression in wild-type p53 HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells but not p53-null HCT116 cells. Moreover, Bcl-2 expression was completely reversed by treatment with pifithrin-α, a p53-specific inhibitor. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 also inhibited apoptosis inNVP-BE235 plus curcumin-treated cells. In contrast,NVP-BEZ235 combined with curcumin did not have a synergistic effect on normal human skin fibroblasts and normal human mesangial cells. Taken together, combined treatment withNVP-BEZ235 and curcumin induces apoptosis through p53-dependent Bcl-2 mRNA down-regulation at the transcriptional level and Mcl-1 protein down-regulation at the post-transcriptional level.

p,"NVP-BEZ235 is a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor currently in phase I clinical trials. We profiled this compound against a panel of breast tumor cell lines to identify the patient populations that would benefit from such treatment. In this setting,NVP-BEZ235 selectively induced cell death in cell lines presenting either HER2 amplification and/or PIK3CA mutation, but not in cell lines with PTEN loss of function or KRAS mutations, for which resistance could be attributed, in part to ERK pathway activity. An in depth analysis of death markers revealed that the cell death observed uponNVP-BEZ235 treatment could be recapitulated with other PI3K inhibitors and that this event is linked to active PARP cleavage indicative of an apoptotic process. Moreover, the effect seemed to be partly independent of the caspase-9 executioner and mitochondrial activated caspases, suggesting an alternate route for apoptosis induction by PI3K inhibitors. Overall, this study will provide guidance for patient stratification for forthcoming breast cancer phase II trials forNVP-BEZ235. PMID:20007781",

It is concluded that almost all fullerene dissolved in NMP is in the aggregates after one month. The reorganization of the aggregates is detected when water is added to the aggregated solution C 60/NMP.

Interday and intraday imprecision was better than 8% for all metabolites, while the limits of detection were between 5 and 20 μg/L depending on the analyte.

Varying doses of nevirapine (NVP) and a number of regimens containing this NNRTI have been studied in antiretroviral (ARV)näive patients. Four key studies have compared the efficacy and safety of triple drug regimens containingNVPin ARVnäive, HIV-1 infected patients. The INCAS study was the first demonstration of how to useNVPin an effective and durable manner: as a component of a triple drug regimen. The COMBINE Study was a comparison of protease inhibitor (PI)-based andNVP-based triple regimens. The Atlantic Study is comparing the safety and efficacy of three triple drug regimens in ARVnäive patients. In this study, treatment consists of a divergent drug regimen (PI and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NRTIs) targeting both HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase or a convergent regimen targeting reverse transcriptase alone (three NRTIs or two NRTIs plus a NNRTI). A clinical endpoint study (BI 1090) compared the efficacy and durability of multi-drug regimens in ARVnäive patients with high baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (pVLs) and low peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Data from these studies confirm that triple regimens containingNVPsuppressed viral replication for up to one year, even when the ARVnäive patients had low CD4+ cell counts at baseline. Nevirapine-containing regimens suppressed pVLs to < 50 copies/ mL in approximately 50% of patients in the studies discussed (Intent to Treat analyses). Data from 96 weeks of follow up in the Atlantic Study demonstrates that the regimens containing didanosine and stavudine plus indinavir orNVPwere significantly more successful in suppressing pVLs to < 50 copies/mL during this period than a regimen composed of these NRTIs and lamivudine (p < or = 0.001).

Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) was used as a reducing agent as well as a surface capping agent to prevent particle aggregation and stabilize the particles.

The high field irreversibility and unsaturatedmore » magnetization behaviours indicate the presence of the core–shell structure in the sample. The exchange bias effect observed at 10 K suggests the existence of the magnetically aligned core surrounded by spin-disordered surface layer.

The incorporation of BNNPs and BNNTs resulted in a ~38% and ~15% increase in compressive (young's) modulus, and ~31% and ~6% increase in compressive yield strength compared to PPF control, respectively. The nanocomposites showed a time-dependent increased protein adsorption for only collagen-I protein. The cytotoxicity evaluation of aqueous BNNT and BNNP dispersions (at 1-100 μg/mL concentrations) using a representative murine MC3T3 preosteoblast cell line showed cytocompatibility of BNNTs and BNNPs (~73-99% viability). The cytotoxicity evaluation of media extracts of nanocomposites prior to crosslinking, after crosslinking and upon degradation (using 1X-100X dilutions) showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity responses. Crosslinked nanocomposites showed excellent (~79-100%) cell viability, cellular attachment (~57-67%), and spreading similar to cells grown on the surface of tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) control. The media extracts of degradation products showed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity. The favorable cytocompatibility results in combination with improved mechanical properties of BNNT and BNNP nanocomposites opens new avenues for further in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy studies for their bone tissue engineering applications.

The resulting particles were monodisperse in size and colloidally stable over a wide range of temperature and ionic strength due to chemically grafted PVP chains. The particle size was also found to be sensitive to ionic strength and pH of the aqueous environment, likely due to the electrostatic repulsion between ionized VBIDA groups. Divalent nickel ions were chelated to the VBIDA groups, allowing selective metal affinity attachment of a His6-Cys peptide. The peptide was released upon the addition of the competitive ligand imidazole, demonstrating that the peptide attachment to the particles is reversible and selective. PMID:24176889",

p,"Purpose: During the past decade, many clinical trials with both monoclonal antibodies and small molecules that target the insulin-like growth factor-type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) have been launched. Despite the important role of IGF-1R signaling in radioresistance, studies of such agents in combination with radiotherapy are lagging behind. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the small molecule IGF-1R kinase inhibitorNVP-AEW541 on the intrinsic radioresistance of prostate cancer cells. Methods and Materials: The effect ofNVP-AEW541 on cell proliferation, cell viability, IGF-1R signaling, radiosensitivity, cell cycle distribution, and double strand break repair was determined inmore » three human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, 22Rv1). Moreover, the importance of the PTEN pathway status was explored by means of transfection experiments with constitutively active Akt or inactive kinase-dead Akt. Results:NVP-AEW541 inhibited cell proliferation and decreased cell viability in a time-and dose-dependent manner in all three cell lines. Radiosensitization was observed in the PTEN wild-type cell lines DU145 and 22Rv1 but not in the PTEN-deficient PC3 cell line.NVP-AEW541-induced radiosensitization coincided with downregulation of phospho-Akt levels and high levels of residual double strand breaks. The importance of PTEN status in the radiosensitization effect was confirmed by transfection experiments with constitutively active Akt or inactive kinase-dead Akt. Conclusions:NVP-AEW541 enhances the effect of ionizing radiation in PTEN wild-type, but not in PTEN-deficient, prostate cancer cells. Proper patient selection based on the PTEN status of the tumor will be critical to the achievement of optimal results in clinical trials in which the combination of radiotherapy and this IGF-1R inhibitor is being explored.« less",

p,"3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) is the most widely used and evaluated chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Antiviral therapy is essential for treatment and prevention of AIDS in adults and children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy and labor. The studies described in this report were designed to determine possible long-term sequelae from AZT treatment, often used in combination with other antiviral drugs, such as lamivudine (3TC) and nevirapine (NVP) in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Male and female heterozygous F1 p53+/- mice were exposed to AZT, 3TC,NVP, or combinations of the chemicals in utero on gestation days (GD) 12 through 18, then administered the same chemical or combination of chemicals by gavage from postnatal day (PND) 1 through PND 28 and then observed until 45 weeks of age. Vehicle control mice received only an aqueous solution containing 0.2% methylcellulose and 0.1% Tween 80. Mice were dosed twice daily until PND 28. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. The study compared three combination doses of AZT, 3TC andNVP(AZT/3TC/NVP-L, AZT/3TC/NVP-M, and AZT/3TC/NVP-H) with the vehicle controls, and compared the individual components with each other at the highest dose (AZT-H, 3TC-H,NVP-H, AZT/3TC-H and AZT/3TC/NVP-H). Because exposure to AZT/3TC/NVP-M and AZT/3TC/NVP-H reduced pup survival, additional litters were required to provide sufficient pups to load the 45-week study. 45-WEEK STUDY: In general, survival was relatively high once the pup exposure phase had been completed, with at least 75% of the mice surviving to terminal sacrifice in all groups.

Our study confirms that NP degrades through C[BOND]Ncleavage, and releases HONO molecules at a slightly elevated temperature (<75°C). As these molecules accumulate inmore » the vapor phase, they react among themselves to create an acidic environment. Therefore, these chemical constituents in the NP vapor significantly accelerate the hydrolysis of EVA-OH polymer. When the hydrolysis occurs in bothvinylacetate and urethane groups and the scission at the cross-linker progresses, EVA-OH becomes vulnerable to further degradation in the NP vapor environment. Finally, through the comprehensive characterization, the possible degradation mechanisms of the terpolymers are proposed.« less",

Macro-RAFT agents from more activated monomers (MAMs) (i.e., styrene (St),N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm), and methyl methacrylate (MMA)) with RS 2 CZH + and less activated monomers (LAMs) (i.e.,vinylacetate (VAc) andN-vinylpyrolidone (NVP)) with RS 2 CZ are prepared by RAFT polymerization and analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis. In all cases, a mass loss consistent with loss of the end group (ZCS 2 H) is observed at temperatures lower than, and largely discrete from, that required for further degradation of the polymer. The temperatures for end group loss and the new end groups formed are strongly dependent on the identity of the R(P)nand the state of the pyridyl Z group; increasing in the series poly(MMA) < poly(St) ∼ poly(NIPAm) < poly(VAc) ∼ poly(NVP) for S 2 CZ and poly(MMA) < poly(St) ∼ poly(NIPAm) for S 2 CZH + . Clean end group removal is possible for poly(St) and poly(NVP). For poly(NIPAm), the thiocarbonyl chain end is removed, but the end group identity is less certain. For poly(MMA) and poly(VAc), some degradation of the polymer accompanies end group loss under the conditions used and further refinement of the process is required. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We developed a sensitive and selective reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay with fluorometric detection for quantification ofNVP-BEZ235 in biological matrices. Liquid-liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether was used for sample pre-treatment, yielding a recovery of >84%. Chromatographic separation ofNVP-BEZ235 and the internal standard (IS)NVP-BBD130 was achieved on a GraceSmart C-18 column by isocratic elution with a mobile phase which consisted of acetonitrile, methanol, and milliQ water adjusted with acetic acid to pH 3.7 (20:36:44, v/v/v). Fluorescence detection using excitation and emission wavelengths of 270 and 425 nm, respectively, provided a selectivity and sensitivity allowing quantification down to 1 ng/ml in human plasma and linear calibration curves within a range of 1-1000 ng/ml. The assay was validated for human plasma, mouse plasma and a range of tissues. The accuracy, within-day and between-day precision for all matrices, was within the generally accepted 15% range.NVP-BEZ235 was stable for 72 h in pretreated samples in reconstitution mixture (acetonitrile-water (30:70, v/v)), but unstable in mouse tissue homogenates upon repeated freeze-thaw cycles or long term storage (≥24 h) at room temperature. A pilot pharmacokinetic study in mice demonstrated the applicability of this method for pharmacokinetic purposes. Overall, this assay is suitable for the pharmacokinetic studies ofNVP-BEZ235 in mice and in human plasma. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

These co-assembled structures are widely investigated as promising building blocks for encapsulation, nanoparticle synthesis, multimodal imaging, and coating technology. Here, the impact on ice growth is investigated of C3Ms containing poly(vinylalcohol), PVA, which is well known for its high ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity. The PVA-based C3Ms are prepared upon co-assembly of poly(4-vinyl-N-methyl-pyridinium iodide) and poly(vinylalcohol)-block-poly(acrylic acid). Their formation conditions, size, and performance as ice recrystallization inhibitors are studied. It is found that the C3Ms exhibit IRI activity at PVA monomer concentrations as low as 1 × 10 -3 m. The IRI efficacy of PVA-C3Ms is similar to that of linear PVA and PVA graft polymers, underlining the influence ofvinylalcohol monomer concentration rather than polymer architecture. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the transfer of specific elements that cause inhibition has not been confirmed, nor has the removal of such contaminants been reported. This study examined the surfaces of materials commonly used in restorative procedures that were contaminated by indirect latex glove contact and then evaluated for inhibition of polymerization of VPS. The effect of selected cleansing procedures was then studied. Four experimental groups (n= 8) were prepared: (1) cleanvinylgloves (control), (2) clean gingival retraction cords (control), (3) contaminatedvinylgloves, and (4) contaminated gingival retraction cord. Microscopic evaluation of the appearance and the characterization of surface particulate contamination were performed for each. Three cleansing protocols were then evaluated for efficacy in cleaningvinylglove surfaces contaminated by latex contact (n= 10): (1) brushing with water, (2) brushing with soap/rinsing with water, (3) cleansing with rubbing alcohol. The subsequent degree of VPS polymerization inhibition was evaluated subjectively. A chi-square test was used for data analysis (alpha=.05). Particulate sulfur elements and sulfur-chloride compounds were present on the contaminated substrates. None of the 3 cleansing procedures eliminated polymerization inhibition (P =.33). Residual elemental sulfur remained on all tested surfaces. Particulate sulfur and sulfur-chloride compounds were identified as the particulate contamination that resulted in polymerization inhibition of the tested VPS dental impression material. Removal of these contaminants from the testedvinylgloves and gingival retraction cord was not possible with the 3 cleansing protocols tested in this study.",

Although DEHP exposure is primarily dietary, whether homevinylflooring contributes to indoor air and urinary metabolite concentrations for these two phthalates is unclear. Exposures to BBzP and DEHP were examined in a prospective birth cohort of New York City children (n=239) using: (i) visual observation of potential phthalate containing flooring, (ii) a 2-week home indoor air sample, and (iii) concurrent urinary metabolites in a subset (n=193). The category ""vinylor linoleum"" flooring was observed in 135 (56%) of monitored rooms; these rooms had statistically significantly higher indoor air geometric mean concentrations of BBzP (23.9 ng/m(3)) than rooms with wood or carpet flooring (10.6 ng/m(3)). Children from homes with ""vinylor linoleum"" flooring also had significantly higher urinary BBzP metabolite concentrations than other children. Indoor air BBzP and urinary metabolite concentrations were correlated positively (Spearman's rho 0.40). By contrast, indoor air DEHP was not associated with flooring type nor with its urinary metabolite concentrations.Vinylflooring in the home may be an important source of children's exposure to BBzP via indoor air.",

While DEHP exposure is primarily dietary, whether homevinylflooring contributes to indoor air and urinary metabolite concentrations for these two phthalates is unclear. Exposures to BBzP and DEHP were examined in a prospective birth cohort of New York City children (n=239) using: (1) visual observation of potential phthalate containing flooring, (2) a two-week home indoor air sample, and (3) concurrent urinary metabolites in a subset (n=193). The category “vinylor linoleum” flooring was observed in 135 (56%) of monitored rooms; these rooms had statistically significantly higher indoor air geometric mean concentrations of BBzP (23.9 ng/m3) than rooms with wood or carpet flooring (10.6 ng/m3). Children from homes with “vinylor linoleum” flooring also had significantly higher urinary BBzP metabolite concentrations than other children. Indoor air BBzP and urinary metabolite concentrations were correlated positively (Spearman’s rho 0.40). By contrast, indoor air DEHP was not associated with flooring type nor with its urinary metabolite concentrations.Vinylflooring in the home may be an important source of children’s exposure to BBzP via indoor air.

The microwave spectra of these two isomers were investigated previously, however not exceeding frequencies of about 65 GHz. In the present investigation, the pure rotational spectra of both species have been investigated at millimeter wavelengths.Vinylmercaptan was produced in a radiofrequency discharge through a constant flow of ethanedithiol at low pressure. Both syn and anti rotamers were observed and new extensive sets of molecular parameters were obtained. Owing to its close structural relationship tovinylalcohol and the astronomical abundance of complex sulfur-bearing molecules,vinylmercaptan is a plausible candidate for future radio astronomical searches.

The major challenges in this field are to develop tougher and more efficient FSCs with a relatively easy and scalable process. Here, we demonstrate a wet-spinning process to produce graphene oxide (GO) fibers from GO dispersions inN-methyl-2-pyrrolidone(NMP), with ethyl acetate as the coagulant. Upon chemical reduction of GO, the resulting NMP-based reduced GO (rGO) fibers (rGO@NMP-Fs) are twice as high in the surface area and toughness but comparable in tensile strength and conductivity as that of the water-based rGO fibers (rGO@H 2 O-Fs). When assembled into parallel FSCs, rGO@NMP-F-based supercapacitors (rGO@NMP-FSCs) offered a specific capacitance of 196.7 F cm -3 (147.5 mF cm -2 ), five times higher than that of rGO@H 2 O-F-based supercapacitors (rGO@H 2 O-FSCs) and also higher than most existing wet-spun rGO-FSCs, as well as those FSCs built with metal wires, graphene/carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers, or even pseudocapacitive materials. In addition, our rGO@NMP-FSCs can provide good bending and cycling stability. The energy density of our rGO@NMP-FSCs reaches ca. 6.8 mWh cm -3 , comparable to that of a Li thin-film battery (4 V/500 μAh).",

The surface of silicon wafer before and after laser ablation was studied using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The results showed that the ablation of silicon surface in liquid by pulsed laser was done by the process of melt expulsion under the influence of the confined plasma-induced pressure or shock wave trapped between the silicon wafer and the liquid. The X-ray diffraction‌ (XRD) pattern of Si wafer after laser ablation showed that 4H-SiC layer is formed on its surface. The formation of the above layer was also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy‌ (XPS), as well as EDX was utilized. The reflectance of samples decreased with increasing pulse energy. Therefore, the morphological alteration and the formation of SiC layer at high energy increase absorption intensity in the UV‌-vis regions. Theoretical calculations confirm that the formation of silicon carbide from graphene oxide and silicon wafer is considerably endothermic. Development of new methods for increasing the reflectance without causing harmful effects is still an important issue for crystalline Si solar cells. By using the method described in this paper, the optical properties of solar cells can be improved.",

The thermochemical property data on thesevinylalcohols and methylvinylethers is important for understanding their stability, reaction paths, and kinetics in atmospheric and thermal hydrocarbon-oxygen systems. Enthalpies , entropies , and heat capacities (C(p)()(T)) are determined for CH(2)=CHOH, C(*)H=CHOH, CH(2)=C(*)OH, CH(2)=CHOCH(3), C(*)H=CHOCH(3), CH(2)=C(*)OCH(3), and CH(2)=CHOC(*)H(2). Molecular structures, vibrational frequencies, , and C(p)(T) are calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) density functional calculation level. Enthalpies are also determined using the composite CBS-Q, CBS-APNO, and G3 methods using isodesmic work reactions to minimize calculation errors. Potential barriers for internal rotors are calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level and used to determine the hindered internal rotational contributions to entropy and heat capacity. The recommended ideal gas phase values calculated in this study are the following (in kcal mol(-1)): -30.0, -28.9 (syn, anti) for CH(2)=CHOH; -25.6, -23.9 for CH(2)=CHOCH(3); 31.3, 33.5 for C(*)H=CHOH; 27.1 for anti-CH(2)=C(*)OH; 35.6, 39.3 for C(*)H=CHOCH(3); 33.5, 32.2 for CH(2)=C(*)OCH(3); 21.3, 22.0 for CH(2)=CHOC(*)H(2). Bond dissociation energies (BDEs) and group additivity contributions are also determined. The BDEs reveal that the O-H, O-CH(3), C-OH, and C-OCH(3) bonds invinylalcohol and methylvinylether are similar in energy to those in the aromatic molecules phenol and methyl phenyl ether, being on average around 3 kcal mol(-1) weaker in thevinylsystems.

The interaction parameter (Δ b) was used to study the miscibility and compatibility of polymer blend in solution, obtained from the modified Krigbaum and Wall theory. Turbidity and FTIR measurements were also used to investigate the miscibility of this pair of polymers.

p,"The first spectroscopic detection ofvinylcyanide (otherwise known as acrylonitrile; C2H3CN) on Titan was obtained by Palmer et al. (2017), based on three rotational emission lines observed with ALMA at millimeter wavelengths (in receiver band 6). The astrobiological significance of this detection was highlighted due to the theorized ability of C2H3CN molecules to combine into cell membrane-like structures under the cold conditions found in Titan's hydrocarbon lakes. Here we report the detection of three additional C2H3CN transitions at higher frequencies (from ALMA band 7 flux calibration data). We present the first emission maps for this gas on Titan, and compare the molecular distribution with that of other nitriles observed with ALMA including HC3N, CH3CN, C2H5CN and HNC. The molecular abundance patterns are interpreted based on our understanding of Titan's high-altitude photochemistry and time-variable global circulation. Similar to the short-lived HC3Nmolecule,vinylcyanide is found to be most abundant in the vicinity of the southern (winter) pole, whereas the longer-lived CH3CN is more concentrated in the north. The vertical abundance profile of C2H3CN (from radiative transfer modeling), as well as its latitudinal distribution, are consistent with a short photochemical lifetime for this species. Complementary results from our more recent (2017) nitrile mapping studies at higher spatial resolution will also be discussed.REFERENCES:Palmer, M. Y., Cordiner, M. A., Nixon, C. A. et al.

p,"The goal of this dissertation is to synthesize and characterize novel polymers, as well as to explore alternative techniques for biomedical applications. Although significant progress has been achieved in the design and preparation of new biomaterials over the past years, much remains to be accomplished. The interactions between biomaterials and cells are very important, especially in the emerging field of tissue engineering. The focus of this research is to improve such interactions via several different approaches. One way to engineer cellular interaction is by modifying surface topography through micro-patterning. Although photolithography is widely used for patterning, it is not suitable for direct cell and protein patterning because of the usage of organic solvent for feature development. To address this issue, a biocompatible chemically amplified resist derived fromN-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone(NVP) was prepared. The results have shown that no organic solvent development was required to reveal the patterns and cells can be cultured on these patterned surfaces directly. Strong cell alignment was observed. The other issue addressed in this research is to develop a technique that can modify surface morphology and surface chemistry simultaneously. Such a technique is called masked ion beam lithography (MIBL). By implanting phosphorous ions on polymeric substrates through masks, not only micron/nano size patterns were generated on the surface, but also the phosphorous ions were incorporated. Incubation of bone forming osteoblast cells on these ion beam processed samples has shown that osteoblast cell attachment to the substrate was enhanced, as a consequence of the increased surface roughness as well as the implanted phosphorous ions. This indicates that MIBL can not only generate micro/nanostructures on the surface of a biocompatible polymer, but can also selectively modify the surface chemistry by implanting with specific ions. These factors can contribute to an",

In the procedure described here the humic acid is dissolved in 2-pyrrolidoneand methylated by the addition of diazomethane in diethyl ether and ethanol to the solution. Because the humic acid is completely dissolved in the reaction medium, disaggregation of the humic acid particles takes place and much more complete methylation is obtained.

p,"N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone(NMP) is widely used as a solvent in polymeric membrane fabrication process, its elimination from the process wastewater (normally at a high concentration > 1000 mg/L) prior to discharge is essential because of environmental concern. This study investigated the feasibility of treating high-strength NMP-containing process wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR; i.e., batch feeding and intermittent aerobic/anoxic condition) and a membrane bioreactor (MBR; i.e., continuous feeding and aeration), respectively. The results showed that the SBR with the acclimated sludge was capable of removing >90% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and almost 98% of NMP within 2 h. In contrast, the MBR with the acclimated sludge showed a decreasing NMP removal efficiency from 100% to 40% over 15-day operation. The HPLC and LC-MS/MS analytical results showed that NMP degradation in SBR and MBR could undergo different pathways. This may be attributed to the dissimilar bacterial community compositions in the SBR and MBR as identified by 16s rRNA gene sequencing analysis. Interestingly, the NMP-degrading capability of the activated sludge derived from MBR could be recovered to >98% after they were operated at the SBR mode (batch feeding mode with intermittent aerobic/anoxic condition). This study reveals that SBR is probably a more feasible process to treat high-strength NMP-containing wastewater, but residual NMP metabolites in the SBR effluent need to be post-treated by an oxidation or adsorption process in order to achieve zero-discharge of toxic chemicals.

The data showed that the diffusion of copper ions from the feed compartment to the receiver compartment depends on the grafting yield of the membranes and the pH of the feed solution. To the contrary, iron ions did not diffuse through the membranes of all grafting yields. However, a limited amount of iron ions diffused in strong acidic medium. This study shows that the prepared membranes could be considered for the separation of copper ions from iron ions.

p,"Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are often dissolved in polymeric matrices to control the gastrointestinal dissolution and to stabilize the amorphous state of the API. During the pharmaceutical development of new formulations, stability studies via storage at certain temperature and relative humidity (RH) have to be carried out to verify the long-term thermodynamic stability of these formulations against unwanted recrystallization and moisture-induced amorphous-amorphous phase separation (MIAPS). This study focuses on predicting the MIAPS of API/polymer formulations at elevated RH. In a first step, the phase behavior of water-free formulations of ibuprofen (IBU) and felodipine (FEL) combined with the polymers poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), poly(vinylacetate) (PVAC) and poly (vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinylacetate) (PVPVA64) was determined experimentally by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The phase behavior of these water-free formulations was modeled using the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT). Based on this, the API solubility and MIAPS in the above-mentioned formulations at humid conditions was predicted in perfect agreement with the results of two-year lasting stability studies at 25°C/0% RH and 40°C/75% RH. MIAPS was predicted and also experimentally found for the FEL/PVP, FEL/PVPVA64 and IBU/PVP formulations, whereas MIAPS was neither predicted nor measured for the IBU/PVPVA64 system and PVAC-containing formulations. It was thus shown that the results of time-consuming long-term stability tests can be correctly predicted via thermodynamic modeling with PC-SAFT. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The ν 15 OH torsional fundamental investigated here is more than 200 cm-1 removed from the next nearest vibration, making it practically unperturbed and ideal to help refine the ground state rotational constants that were previously determined from 25 microwave lines. We assigned 1335 lines within the ν 15 fundamental centered at 261.5512 cm-1, with J and K a ranges of 1-59 and 0-16, respectively. The microwave and far-infrared line positions were fit with Watson-type A- and S-reduced Hamiltonians, with the inclusion of quartic and select sextic distortion terms. This resulted in a significant refinement of the ground state constants, in addition to the determination of the {ν }15=1 state constants for the first time. The spectroscopic parameters are in good agreement with the results from anharmonic coupled-cluster calculations, and should be useful in searches for rotationally and/or vibrationally warm anti-vinylalcohol in interstellar molecular clouds.",

This issue is relevant, because occupational exposure to high levels ofvinylchloride may still occur. We report a unique case of sequential occurrences of hepatocellular carcinoma and angiosarcoma of the liver, in avinylchloride-exposed worker without cirrhosis and any known risk factor for chronic liver disease. Both the hepatocellular carcinoma and the surrounding normal liver showed micronucleus formation, which reflects genotoxic effect ofvinylchloride. Angiosarcoma showed a KRAS G12D point mutation, which is considered to be characteristic ofvinylchloride-induced angiosarcoma.

p,"OBJECTIVES: To study the acute effects of exposure to the increasingly used solvent,N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone(NMP) in male volunteers. Further, to determine the NMP concentration in plasma and urine during and after the exposure. METHODS: Six male volunteers were exposed for eight hours on four different days to 0, 10, 25, and 50 mg/m3 NMP. Plasma was collected and urine was sampled during and after the exposure. Changes in nasal volume were measured by acoustic rhinometry and in airway resistance by spirometry. RESULTS: The eight-hour experimental exposure to 10, 25, and 50 mg/m3 did not induce discomfort to eyes or upper airways. Acute changes in nasal volume were not found, and no changes in the spirometric data could be registered. The elimination curves suggested a non-linear pattern and at the end of exposure showed mean (range) half lifes of NMP in plasma of about 4.0 (2.9-5.8) hours and in urine 4.5 (3.5-6.6) hours. The unmetabolised NMP found in urine samples collected during exposure and at the subsequent 44 hours corresponded to about 2% of the calculated absorbed dose. At the end of the exposure there was a close correlation between exposures and the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of NMP. CONCLUSIONS: NMP was absorbed through the respiratory tract and readily eliminated from the body, mainly by biotransformation to other compounds. Exposure to 10, 25, or 50 mg/m3 NMP did not cause nose, eye, or airway irritation. Thus, NMP is a mild irritant. PMID:9166128",

The average crystallite size was obtained by using line profile fitting as 11 ± 5 nm. The saturation magnetization value decreases with usage of the ethylene glycol inmore » synthesis. The observed exchange bias effect further confirms the existence of the magnetically ordered core surrounded by spin-disordered surface layer and the ethylene glycol. Square-root temperature dependence of coercivity can be fitted to Kneller's law in the temperature range of 10–400 K. The reduced remanent magnetization values lower than the theoretical value of 0.5 for non-interacting single domain particles indicate the CoFe{sub 2}O{sub 4}-1-methyl-2-pyrrolidonenanocomposite to have uniaxial anisotropy instead of the expected cubic anisotropy according to the Stoner–Wohlfarth model.« less",

It is found that the effect of induced optical anisotropy is based on the transfer of electron excitation energy from donor (sensitizer) molecules to acceptor molecules and is observed in the course of phototopochemical biomolecular cyclization reaction of cinnamate fragments in polymer macromolecules. The detected photoinduced anisotropy in solid films of poly(vinylcinnamate) and its derivative poly(vinyl-4-metoxicinnamate) ensures sensitized photo-orientation of low-molecular thermotropic liquid crystals.,

NBR nanocomposites were obtained by controlling both the mixing and vulcanization conditions, by using a Brabender mixer and hot-press process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that, depending on the amount of montmorillonite that is added, both exfoliated and intercalated nanocomposite structures are formed. The NBR/DAVBA-MMT nanocomposites exhibit much higher mechanical properties (e.g., tensile strength, Young's modulus, 300% modulus, and hardness) as well as gas barrier properties as compared to NBR Na+-MMT or NBR composites generated from modified montmorillonites withoutvinylgroups. Consistent with the results of XRD, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that the intercalation and exfoliation structures of the nanocomposites coexist and that the DAVBA-MMT layers are well dispersed in NBR.",

p,"Vinylalcohol has two rotameric forms, known as syn- and anti-vinylalcohol, where syn is the most stable. While both have been investigated by microwave and far-infrared spectroscopy, only the syn rotamer has been investigated by mid-infrared spectroscopy. This is due to the low anti rotamer population (15%) at room temperature, in addition to the closeness in proximity of the mid-infrared bands between the rotamers; this results in overlapping bands that are dominated by syn-vinylalcohol absorptions. In this investigation we increase the anti-vinylalcohol population to 40% by using a high temperature ""pyrolysis"" source, and eliminate the spectral overlap by recording the spectra at low temperature in helium nanodroplets. We observe a number of bands of both rotamers in the OH, CH, and CO stretching regions that display rotational substructure. A highlight of this work is the observation of a Fermi dyad in the OH stretching region of anti-vinylalcohol. Anharmonic frequency calculations suggest that this is due to a near degeneracy of the OH stretching state (νb{1}) with a triple combination involving νb{7}, νb{8}, and νb{9}. M. Rodler, J. Mol.

The study was supported by AFM scans, which showed an increase in surface roughness and the presence of spike-like structures, due to interaction of dopant with the polymeric blend. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) scans revealed two stages of degradation in KMnO4 doped PVA - PVP blend films.",

p,"Amorphous formulations of APIs in polymers tend to absorb water from the atmosphere. This absorption of water can induce API recrystallization, leading to reduced long-term stability during storage. In this work, the phase behavior of different formulations was investigated as a function of relative humidity. Indomethacin and naproxen were chosen as model APIs and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinylacetate) (PVPVA64) as excipients. The formulations were prepared by spray drying. The water sorption in pure polymers and in formulations was measured at 25°C and at different values of relative humidity (RH=25%, 50% and 75%). Most water was absorbed in PVP-containing systems, and water sorption was decreasing with increasing API content. These trends could also be predicted in good agreement with the experimental data using the thermodynamic model PC-SAFT. Furthermore, the effect of absorbed water on API solubility in the polymer and on the glass-transition temperature of the formulations was predicted with PC-SAFT and the Gordon-Taylor equation, respectively. The absorbed water was found to significantly decrease the API solubility in the polymer as well as the glass-transition temperature of the formulation. Based on a quantitative modeling of the API/polymer phase diagrams as a function of relative humidity, appropriate API/polymer compositions can now be selected to ensure long-term stable amorphous formulations at given storage conditions.

p,"Aberrant activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor is frequently observed in neoplasia, notably in tumors of epithelial origin. Attempts to treat such tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists resulted in remarkable success in recent studies. Little is known, however, about the efficacy of this therapy in biliary tract cancer. Protein expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 was assessed in seven human biliary tract cancer cell lines by immunoblotting. In addition, histological sections from 19 patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expression by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, we sequenced the cDNA products representing the entire epidermal growth factor receptor coding region of the seven cell lines, and searched for genomic epidermal growth factor receptor amplifications and polysomy by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Cell growth inhibition by gefitinib erlotinib andNVP-AEE788 was studied in vitro by automated cell counting. In addition, the anti-tumoral effect of erlotinib andNVP-AEE788 was studied in a chimeric mouse model. The anti-tumoral drug mechanism in this model was assessed by MIB-1 antibody staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling assay, von Willebrand factor staining, and immunoblotting for p-p42/44 (p-Erk1/2, p-MAPK) and p-AKT. Immunoblotting revealed expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in all biliary tract cancer cell lines. EGFR was detectable in six of 19 (32%) extrahepatic human cholangiocarcinoma tissue samples, ErbB-2 in 16 of 19 (84%), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in nine of 19 (47%). Neither epidermal growth factor receptor mutations nor amplifications or polysomy were found in the seven biliary tract cancer",

The two cyclic adducts have been detected in DNA exposed to these mutagens. A new method has been developed for the synthesis of deoxyguanosine adducts of chlorooxirane and acrolein, as well as oligonucleotides containing these adducts. Reaction of O(6)-[(trimethylsilyl)ethyl]-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyinosine with the appropriate aminodiol followed by oxidative cleavage of the diol with NaIO(4) gave the adducts in excellent yields. Reaction of oligonucleotides containing the halonucleoside with the aminodiols followed by NaIO(4) efficiently created the nucleosides in the oligonucleotides. Deoxyadenosine adducts were created similarly using 6-chloropurine 9-(2'-deoxyriboside).",

Since biopharmaceutical and pharmacological properties of this drug depend on biochemical transformation its components, of the aim of this work was to determine the structure of possible ionized pyridoxine andpyrrolidonecarboxylate forms and their reaction ability in biochemical processes. Physical-chemical properties of compounds (pKa, logP, logD, proton donor/acceptor quantity, solubility (g/l)) were calculated with ACD/pKaDB program or obtained from Pub-Med physical/chemical properties database. UV spectra of compounds were obtained after dissolution in different pH solutions (1.0, 4.5 and 6.8). It was found that at different pH values one can observe changes of the absorption spectra due to the presence of prevailing amount of the protonated form. An analysis of both pKa, logP and logD indicators and reactive functional groups of Methadoxine components has revealed that they can be protonated in different regions of gastro-intestinal tract, that influences their solubility in hydrophilic and lypophilic media. Pharmacological properties of pyridoxine andpyrrolidonecarboxylate themselves are performed after their preliminary biotransformation to active metabolites. Only ionic interaction between Methadoxine components in the substance composition can appear, that provides its pharmaceutical stability and ensures its activity only in the organism conditions.",

These measurements indicated that the appearance of the LSPR band is not associated with the growth in size but is ascribed to electron doping to the Au sp band by the adsorbed H atoms.",

Through systematic optimization experiments, the conditions effecting the olefin selectivity were examined. In general, more polar solvents such as DMF favored the formation of the E-isomer, and less polar solvents such as acetone favored formation of the Z-isomer. The optimized conditions for the formation of E-vinylchlorides were found to be the use of cyclopentadienyl ruthenium (II) cyclooctadiene chloride, stannic chloride pentahydrate as a cocatalyst, and for a chloride source, either ammonium chloride in DMF/water mixtures or tetramethylammonium chloride in DMF. A range of several other ruthenium (II) catalysts was also shown to be effective. A wide variety ofvinylchlorides could be formed under these conditions. Substrates with tethered alcohols or ketones either five or six carbons from the alkyne portion gave instead diketone or cyclohexenone products. For formation ofvinylbromides, a catalyst system involving the use of cyclopentadienylruthenium (II) tris(acetonitrile) hexafluorophosphate with stannic bromide as a cocatalyst was found to be most effective. The use of ammonium bromide in DMF/acetone mixtures was optimal for the synthesis of E-vinylbromides, and the use of lithium bromide in acetone was optimal for formation of the corresponding Z-isomer. Under either set of conditions, a wide range ofvinylbromides could be formed. When alkynes with propargylic substituents are used, enhanced selectivity for formation of the Z-isomer is observed. When aryl acetylenes are used as the coupling partners, complete selectivity for the Z-isomer is obtained. A mechanism involving a cis or trans halometalation is invoked to explain formation of the observed products. Thevinylhalides have been shown to be precursors to alpha-hydroxy ketones and cyclopentenones, and as coupling partners in Suzuki-type reactions.",

p,"Vinylalcohol and acetaldehyde are isoelectronic products of incomplete butanol combustion. Along with the radicals resulting from the removal of atomic hydrogen or the hydroxyl radical, these species are studied here using ab initio methods as complete as coupled cluster theory with single, double, triple, and perturbative quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)], with basis sets as large as cc-pV5Z. The relative energies provided herein are further refined by including corrections for relativistic effects, the frozen core approximation, and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The effects of anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies are also treated. The syn conformer ofvinylalcohol is predicted to be lower in energy than the anti conformer by 1.1 kcal mol -1 . The alcoholic hydrogen of syn-vinylalcohol is found to be the easiest to remove, requiring 84.4 kcal mol -1 . Five other radicals are also carefully considered, with four conformers investigated for the 1-hydroxyvinyl radical. Beyond energetics, we have conducted an overhaul of the spectroscopic literature for these species. Our results also provide predictions for fundamental modes yet to be reported experimentally. To our knowledge, the ν 3 (3076 cm -1 ) and ν 4 (2999 cm -1 ) C-H stretches for syn-vinylalcohol and all but one of the vibrational modes for anti-vinylalcohol (ν 1 -ν 14 ) are yet to be observed experimentally. For the acetyl radical, ν 6 (1035 cm -1 ), ν 11 (944 cm -1 ), ν 12 (97 cm -1 ), and accounting for our changes to the assignment of the 1419.9 cm -1 experimental mode, ν 10 (1441 cm -1 ), are yet to be observed. We have predicted these unobserved fundamentals and reassigned the experimental 1419.9 cm -1 frequency in the acetyl radical to ν 4 rather than to ν 10 . Our work also strongly supports reassignment of the ν 10 and ν 11 fundamentals of the vinoxy radical. We suggest that the bands assigned to the overtones of these fundamentals were in fact combination bands. Our",

p,"The studies described in this dissertation focus on improvement of mechanical properties of current glass-ionomer cements. Thermal properties and microstructures of the cements were correlated with their mechanical strengths. The first study evaluated mechanical properties of selected commercial glass-ionomer cements and examined their microstructures. The results showed that resin-modified glass-ionomer cements (RM GICs) exhibited much higher flexural (FS) and diametral tensile strengths (DTS), compared to conventional GICs (C GICs). In addition, they exhibited comparable compressive strength (CS), relatively low microhardness and less wear resistance than C GICs. The C GICs exhibited brittle behavior, whereas the RM GICs underwent substantial plastic deformation in compression. The mechanical properties of the GICs were closely related to their microstructures. Factors such as the density of the microstructure, the integrity of the interface between the glass particles and polymer matrix, particle size and the number and size of voids have important roles in determining the mechanical properties. The second study evaluated thermal properties of these GICs. The results showed that the RM GICs exhibited higher thermal transition temperatures than those of the C GICs, thermal expansion coefficients of these cements were close to those of human teeth, and the indentation creep of the RM GICs were higher than the C GICs. The third study explored and evaluated the effect of a water-soluble monomer,N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP), on the performance of current C GICs, indicating a significant improvement in both mechanical and working properties. The fourth study demonstrated the process of determining the optimal molar ratio of theNVP-containing copolymers, using design of experiment. The results showed that the optimal molar ratio for these copolymers was 7:1:3 for poly(acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid-co-N-vinylpyrrolidone), based on the FS test. The molar ratio of 8:2:1 (AA:IA:NVP",

p,"The objective of this study was to enhance the mechanical strength of glass-ionomer cements, while preserving their unique clinical properties. Copolymers incorporating several different segments includingN-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) in different molar ratios were synthesized. The synthesized polymers were copolymers of acrylic acid andNVPwith side chains containing itaconic acid. In addition, nano-hydroxyapatite and fluoroapatite were synthesized using an ethanol-based sol-gel technique. The synthesized polymers were used in glass-ionomer cement formulations (Fuji II commercial GIC) and the synthesized nanoceramic particles (nano-hydroxy or fluoroapatite) were also incorporated into commercial glass-ionomer powder, respectively. The synthesized materials were characterized using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Compressive, diametral tensile and biaxial flexural strengths of the modified glass-ionomer cements were evaluated. After 24h setting, theNVPmodified glass-ionomer cements exhibited higher compressive strength (163-167 MPa), higher diametral tensile strength (DTS) (13-17 MPa) and much higher biaxial flexural strength (23-26 MPa) in comparison to Fuji II GIC (160 MPa in CS, 12MPa in DTS and 15 MPa in biaxial flexural strength). The nano-hydroxyapatite/fluoroapatite added cements also exhibited higher CS (177-179 MPa), higher DTS (19-20 MPa) and much higher biaxial flexural strength (28-30 MPa) as compared to the control group. The highest values for CS, DTS and BFS were found forNVP-nanoceramic powder modified cements (184 MPa for CS, 22 MPa for DTS and 33 MPa for BFS) which were statistically higher than control group. It was concluded that, bothNVPmodified and nano-HA/FA added glass-ionomer cements are promising restorative dental materials with improved mechanical properties.",

p,"RAFT solution polymerization ofN-(2-(methacryoyloxy)ethyl)pyrrolidone(NMEP) in ethanol at 70 °C was conducted to produce a series of PNMEP homopolymers with mean degrees of polymerization (DP) varying from 31 to 467. Turbidimetry was used to assess their inverse temperature solubility behavior in dilute aqueous solution, with an LCST of approximately 55 °C being observed in the high molecular weight limit. Then a poly(glycerol monomethacylate) (PGMA) macro-CTA with a mean DP of 63 was chain-extended with NMEP using a RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization formulation at 70 °C. The target PNMEP DP was systematically varied from 100 up to 6000 to generate a series of PGMA 63 -PNMEP x diblock copolymers. High conversions (≥92%) could be achieved when targeting up to x = 5000. GPC analysis confirmed high blocking efficiencies and a linear evolution in Mnwith increasing PNMEP DP. A gradual increase in M w / Mnwas also observed when targeting higher DPs. However, this problem could be minimized ( M w / Mn< 1.50) by utilizing a higher purity grade of NMEP (98% vs 96%). This suggests that the broader molecular weight distributions observed at higher DPs are simply the result of a dimethacrylate impurity causing light branching, rather than an intrinsic side reaction such as chain transfer to polymer. Kinetic studies confirmed that the RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization of NMEP was approximately four times faster than the RAFT solution polymerization of NMEP in ethanol when targeting the same DP in each case. This is perhaps surprising because both 1 H NMR and SAXS studies indicate that the core-forming PNMEP chains remain relatively solvated at 70 °C in the latter formulation. Moreover, dissolution of the initial PGMA 63 -PNMEP x particles occurs on cooling from 70 to 20 °C as the PNMEP block passes through its LCST. Hence this RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization formulation offers an efficient route to a high molecular weight water-soluble polymer",

Especially, to prepare P(VPi/VAc) and PVAc microparticles having various particle sizes and uniform particle size distribution,vinylpivalate (VPi)/vinylacetate (VAc) and VAc were suspension-polymerized using a low-temperature initiator, 2,2""-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile).

p,"Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) using hypericin (HY), a natural photosensitizer, detects bladder cancer significantly better than white light endoscopy. However, the lipophilicity of HY complicates its administration for clinical applications. Currently, pharmaceutical preparations for HY without plasma protein are being developed. Formulations containing a biocompatible solvent,N-methylpyrrolidone(NMP) have been shown to enhance the photodynamic therapeutic effects of HY. It was recently reported that, NMP formulations of HY were able to produce significantly higher contrast for fluorescence detection of tumors than albumin-containing HY formulations. This present work hypothesizes that NMP acts both as a solvent and penetration enhancer to improve the delivery of HY into cells by increasing the permeability of cell membranes. This paper reports the use of 3-D confocal microscopy to monitor real-time uptake of HY in human carcinoma. 3-D confocal microscopy was used to investigate the possibility of nuclear localization of HY in MGH cells. The fluorescence of HY was confirmed to be emitted from HY containing cells using spectrometry. The localization of a DNA fluorescent probe 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) was used to confirm the possibility of colocalization of DAPI and HY. The colocalization analysis in the present study suggests that it was very unlikely that HY colocalized in the nucleus that was stained by DAPI. Fluorescein leakage tests showed that 1% NMP changes the permeability of cell membranes, and enhanced the delivery of HY into cells resulting in lower cell survival ratios. Thus, NMP was able to enhance the photodynamic therapeutic effects of HY on cancer cells.",

Two large multicentre mortality cohort studies, one American and another European, reported higher mortality for primary cancer of liver and biliary tract. However, the American study was not able to rule out misclassification, because based on death certificates and under the heading primary liver cancers, some angiosarcomas, the typical neoplasia associated withvinylchloride, may have been included. The American study does not report on cirrhosis mortality. The European study also reports higher mortality of primary liver cancer, but contrary to the American study in a further analysis based on 10 verified cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, an exposure-response trend with duration of employment and with cumulative exposure tovinylchloride was detected. A smaller cohort belonging to this multicentre cohort confirmed these results. Meta-analyses based on the two large cohorts concluded for a small excess of primary liver cancer, although misclassification could not be ruled out. Excess risk of cirrhosis was reported in the European cohort, in a subcohort and in a cross-sectional study. However, a meta-analysis did not confirm this excess. Several critical appraisals of the literature reached antithetical conclusions about hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis and occupational exposures tovinylchloride. For both hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, a study suggests an additive and multiplicative effect ofvinylchloride exposure with viral hepatitis and alcohol consumption respectively. Pathology reports seem to indicate a possible development of hepatocellular carcinoma but not of cirrhosis after high exposures tovinylchloride. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The blends and pure PLA were irradiated by gamma rays to investigate the extent of changes in the packaging material during gamma ray sterilization process. The miscibility of the blends was dependent on the blend composition andvinylalcohol content; gamma irradiation had little effect on the extent of miscibility. The glass transition temperature of pure PLA and PLA/P(VAc-co-VA) miscible blends reduced after irradiation. On the other hand in PLA/P(VAc-co-VA) immiscible blends, while the glass transition temperature of the PLA phase decreased; that of the copolymer phase slightly increased. The reduction in the glass transition was about 10 percent for samples irradiated with 50 kGy indicating dominance of chain scission of PLA molecules at high irradiation dose. The latter was verified by drop in mechanical properties of pure PLA after exposing to gamma irradiation at 50 kGy. Blending of PLA with the copolymer P(VAc-co-VA) compensated greatly the adverse effects of irradiation on PLA. The oxygen-barrier property of the blend was superior to the neat PLA and remained almost intact with irradiation. The un-irradiated and irradiated blends had excellent transparency. Gamma ray doses used for sterilization purposes are usually less than 20 kGy.

In this new hybrid system, poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and thermo-sensitive amphiphilic biocompatible poly (vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) were used to create suitable storage for hydrophobic drugs. The possibility of using variable PVP/PEG molar ratios to modulate drug release rate from silica nanoparticles was a primary goal of the current research. In addition, an investigation of the drug release kinetic was conducted. To achieve this, silica nanoparticles were synthesized in poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly (vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) solution incorporated with enrofloxacin (EFX) (as a model hydrophobic drug), using a simple synthetic strategy of hybrid materials which avoided waste and multi-step processes. The impacts of PVP/PEG molar ratios, temperature, and pH of the release medium on release kinetic were investigated. The physicochemical properties of the drug-loaded composites were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In vitro drug release studies demonstrated that the drug release rate, which was evaluated by analyzing the experimental data with seven kinetic models in a primarily non-Fickian diffusion-controlled process, aligned well with both Ritger-Peppas and Sahlin-Peppas equations.",

p,The enantioselective α-vinylationof aldehydes usingvinyliodonium triflate salts has been accomplished via the synergistic combination of copper and chiral amine catalysis. These mild catalytic conditions provide a direct route for the enantioselective construction of enolizable α-formylvinylicstereocenters without racemization or olefin transposition. These high-value coupling adducts are readily converted into a variety of useful olefin synthons. PMID:22616631,

p,"A series ofpyrrolidone-based polymers is prepared from pyroglutamic acid, a bio-derived resource. Polymers bearing simple alkoxy substituents (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, and butoxy) are soluble in common organic solvents and possess glass transition temperatures that are dependent on the length of the alkoxy residue. Replacing these substituents with an ether moiety (CH3 OCH2 CH2 O-) affords a highly sensitive and reversible thermoresponsive polymer with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 42 °C in water. Copolymers composed of repeat units bearing both the ether and simple alkoxy residues are found to exhibit LCSTs that are highly dependent on the nature of the hydrophobic alkoxy residue suggesting that the LCSTs of these polymers can be successfully tuned by simply tailoring the copolymer structure.

These materials were investigated by density measurements in highly dilute aqueous solutions. The molar volume results allow us to discuss the effect of the carboxylic groups and the contributions from the comonomeric principal chain. The PAA presents the smaller V, while the largest V value was for AMVP. The V of PHM shows a linear relationship with the number of methylene groups in the lateral chain. It is found that the magnitude of the contribution per methylene group decreases as the hydrophobic character of the environment increases.",

Compared with undoped PNVC–Ppy, the DBSA-doped PNVC–Ppy copolymer showed higher solubility in some selected organic solvents. The composition and structural characteristics of the DBSA-doped PNVC–Ppy were determined by Fourier transform infrared, ultraviolet–visible, and X-ray diffraction spectroscopic methods. Field emission scanning electron microscopic method was employed to observe the morphology of the DBSA-doped PNVC–Ppy copolymer. The electrical conductivity of the DBSA-doped PNVC–Ppy copolymer was measured at room temperature. The conductivity increased with increasing concentration of APS oxidant, and the highest conductivity was recorded at 0.004 mol/dm3 APS at a polymerization temperature of −5 °C. The increased conductivity can be explained by the extended half-life of pyrrole free radical at a lower temperature and a gradual increase in chain length over a prolonged time due to the slow addition of APS. Furthermore, the obtained soluble copolymer exhibits unique optical and thermal properties different from those of PNVC and Ppy. PMID:29491808",

Blood and breast milk samples of 39 HIV-1-infected Ugandan women were taken 6-12 weeks afterNVP-SD intake. Samples were analysed by population sequencing and allele-specific real-time PCR (AS-PCR) with detection limits forNVP-resistant HIV-1 variants (K103Nand Y181C) of < 1% of the total viral population.

Resistance in breast milk was higher at week 6 (6/13 samples [46%]) compared with week 12 (1/6 samples [17%]). In total, 10 drug-resistant populations harbouring the K103Nand/or Y181C mutation were detected in the 19 breast milk samples; 7 (70%) were caused by resistant minorities (< 5% of the total HIV-1 population).

In this study, a combination of field geochemical analyses and laboratory radiotracer ([1,2-14C]vinylchloride) experiments was utilized to assess the potential for intrinsic biodegradation ofvinylchloride contamination in an Fe(III)-reducing, anaerobic aquifer. Microcosm experiments conducted under Fe(III)-reducing conditions with material from the Fe(III)-reducing, chlorinated-ethene contaminated aquifer demonstrated significant oxidation of [1,2-14C]vinylchloride to 14CO2 with no detectable production of ethene or other reductive dehalogenation products. Rates of degradation derived from the microcosm experiments (0.9-1.3% d-1) were consistent with field-estimated rates (0.03-0.2% d-1) of apparentvinylchloride degradation. Field estimates of apparentvinylchloride biodegradation were calculated using two distinct approaches; 1) a solute dispersion model and 2) a mass balance assessment. These findings demonstrate that degradation under Fe(III) reducing conditions can be an environmentally significant mechanism for intrinsic bioremediation ofvinylchloride in anaerobic ground-water systems.",

Six pigs (group A) were embolized with NBCA, and 6 pigs (group B) were embolized with sodium acrylate-vinylalcohol copolymer particles. Computed tomographic volumetry of the embolized lobe (EL) and the nonembolized lobe (NEL), along with liver function tests, was performed before and at 14 and 28 days after embolization. Tissue samples from bothmore » lobes were taken 14 and 28 days after PPVE. Results: NEL-volume and NEL-ratio increases were significantly higher in group A at 14 and 28 days after PPVE (78 and 52% and 91 and 66%, respectively) than in group B (32 and 12% and 28 and 10%, respectively) (p < 0.05). Percent change of the EL-volume was significantly higher for group A at 28 days after PPVE. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups regarding hepatocyte proliferation on the NEL and apoptosis on the EL at both time intervals.

In the present study, we investigated that the nature of the anion present in polysulfobetaines affects activity against certain microorganisms and their anti-microbial properties have been rationalized in terms of the structure-activity relationship.Vinylimidazolium-based polysulfobetaines were prepared by the quaternization of poly(N-vinylimidazole) with sodium salt of 2-bromo ethanesulfonic acid. The bromide counter anion of the resulting polymer was exchanged with different anions to generate a series of polymers. These were characterized by FTIR, DSC, XRD, SEM, elemental analysis (C, H,Nand S) and viscosity measurements. The anti-microbial activity studies were carried against three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Byssochlamys fulva and Mucor circenelliods) and two bacteria (Bacillus coagulans BTS-3 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa BTS-2). The nature of the anion affects the structure of polysulfobetaine by realignment of polymer chains. The anion-dependent anti-microbial properties of polysulfobetaines result from the interaction of the microbes at the polymer interface. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The discovery of this long-sought compound could reveal tantalizing clues to the mysterious origin of complex organic molecules in space.VinylAlcohol and its fellow isomers ""The discovery ofvinylalcohol is significant,"" said Barry Turner, a scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville, Va., ""because it gives us an important tool for understanding the formation of complex organic compounds in interstellar space. It may also help us better understand how life might arise elsewhere in the Cosmos.""Vinylalcohol is an important intermediary in many organic chemistry reactions on Earth, and the last of the three stable members of the C2H4O group of isomers (molecules with the same atoms, but in different arrangements) to be discovered in interstellar space. Turner and his colleague A. J. Apponi of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory in Tucson detected thevinylalcohol in Sagittarius B -- a massive molecular cloud located some 26,000 light-years from Earth near the center of our Galaxy. The astronomers were able to detect the specific radio signature ofvinylalcohol during the observational period of May and June of 2001. Their results have been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Of the approximately 125 molecules detected in interstellar space, scientists believe that most are formed by gas-phase chemistry, in which smaller molecules (and occasionally atoms) manage to ""lock horns"" when they collide in space. This process, though efficient at creating simple molecules, cannot explain howvinylalcohol and other complex chemicals are formed in detectable amounts.

Such interpolymer-networked systems were extensively used for biomedical and desalination applications but they were not examined for their potential use as membranes or separators for batteries. Therefore, the chemical interactions between these two polymers and the influence of such crosslinking on physicochemical properties of the membrane are systematically investigated through rheology and by critical gel point study. The hydrogen bonding and the chemical interaction between PMVE-MA and PVA resulted in highly cross-linked membranes. Effect of the molecular weight of PVA on the membrane properties was also examined. The developed membranes were extensively characterized by studying their physicochemical properties (water uptake, swelling ratio, and conductivity), thermal and electrochemical properties using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The DSC study shows the presence of a single Tg in the membranes indicating compatibility of the two polymers in flexible and transparent films. The membranes show good stability and ion conductivity suitable for separator applications. PMID:28347019",

p,"Currently there are several compounds used as drugs or studied as new chemical entities, which have an electron withdrawing group connected to avinylicdouble bond in a phenolic or catecholic core structure. These compounds share a common feature--current computational methods utilizing the Hammett type equation for the prediction of ionisation constants fail to give accurate prediction of pK(a)'s for compounds containing thevinylicmoiety. The hypothesis was that the effect of electron-withdrawing substituents on the pK(a) of p-vinylphenols is due to the delocalized electronic structure of these compounds. Thus, this effect should be additive for multiple substituents attached to thevinylicdouble bond and quantifiable by LFER-based methods. The aim of this study was to produce an improved equation with a reduced tendency to underestimate the effect of the double bond on the ionisation of the phenolic hydroxyl. To this end a set of 19 para-substitutedvinylphenols was used. The ionisation constants were measured potentiometrically, and a training set of 10 compounds was selected to build a regression model (r2 = 0.987 and S.E. = 0.09). The average error with an external test set of six compounds was 0.19 for our model and 1.27 for the ACD-labs 7.0. Thus, we have been able to significantly improve the existing model for prediction of the ionisation constants of substituted p-vinylphenols.",

Subsequently, the reaction of methacryloyl chloride with the hydroxyl groups on the surfaces of HEMA/NVPmicrospheres was performed, leading to the introduction of polymerisable double bonds onto the surfaces of microspheres HEMA/NVP. Afterward, methacrylic acid was allowed to be graft-polymerized on microspheres HEMA/NVPin the manner of ""grafting from"", resulting in the grafted microspheres PMAA-HEMA/NVP. The grafted microspheres PMAA-HEMA/NVPwere fully characterized with several means. The graft-polymerization of MAA on microspheres HEMA/NVPwas studied in detail, and the optimal reaction conditions were determined. Thereafter, the adsorption property of the grafted microspheres PMAA-HEMA/NVPfor lysozyme as a basic protein model was preliminarily examined to explore the feasibility of removing deleterious basic protein such as density lipoprotein from blood. The experimental results indicate that the PMAA grafting degree on microspheres HEMA/NVPis limited because an enwinding polymer layer as a kinetic barrier on the surfaces of HEMA/NVPmicrospheres will be formed during the graft-polymerization, and block the graft-polymerization. In order to enhance PMAA grafting degree, reaction temperature, monomer concentration and the used amount of initiator should be effectively controlled. The experimental results also reveal that the grafted microspheres PMAA-HEMA/NVPpossess very strong adsorption ability for lysozyme by right of strong electrostatic interaction.

Using the antiretroviral drug nevirapine (NVP) as a model, this work aimed to validate rat hepatocyte 3D spheroid cultures as competent in vitro systems to assess drug metabolism and bioactivation. Hepatocyte spheroids were cultured for 12 days in a stirred tank system (3D cultures) and exposed to equimolar dosages ofNVPand its two major Phase I metabolites, 12-OH-NVPand 2-OH-NVP. Phase INVPmetabolites were detected in the 3D cultures during the whole culture time in the same relative proportions reported in in vivo studies. Moreover, the modulation of SULT1A1 activity byNVPand 2-OH-NVPwas observed for the first time, pointing their synergistic effect as a key factor in the formation of the toxic metabolite (12-sulfoxy-NVP). Covalent adducts formed by reactiveNVPmetabolites withN-acetyl-L-cysteine and bovine serum albumin were also detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry, providing new evidence on the relative role of the reactiveNVPmetabolites, 12-sulfoxy-NVP, andNVPquinone methide, in toxicity versus excretion pathways. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the validity of the 3D culture system to evaluate drug bioactivation, enabling the identification of potential biomarkers of bioactivation/toxicity, and providing new evidence to the mechanisms underlyingNVP-induced toxic events. This model, integrated with the analytical strategies described herein, is of anticipated usefulness to the pharmaceutical industry, as an upstream methodology for flagging drug safety alerts in early stages of drug development.",

Protrusion-, scale-, and joint-like structures of the PNIPAAm grafts on the PVC fibers were formed upon increasing the molecular weight of the PNIPAAm grafts. The PNIPAAm-grafted PVC fibrous mats exhibited completely wetted surfaces at 25 °C because of their high roughness. The static water contact angle of the PNIPAAm-grafted PVC fibrous mats reached 140° when the temperature was increased to 45 °C. This thermoresponsive behavior was significantly greater than that of the PNIPAAm grafted on a flat surface. Temperature-responsive membranes were constructed having a pore size of 1.38 μm and applied as protein valves to block and release an antibody (fluorescein-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG). At 25 °C, the collection efficiency remained at 94% for antibody concentrations up to 60 ng/L. As the temperature increased to 45 °C, the collection efficiency decreased abruptly, to 4%, when the antibody concentration was greater than 20 ng/L.

p,"Highly enantio- and diastereoselective methods for the synthesis of a variety of cyclopropyl alcohols are reported. These methods represent the first one-pot approaches to syn-vinylcyclopropyl alcohols, syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols, and anti-cyclopropyl alcohols from achiral precursors. The methods begin with enantioselective C–C bond formations promoted by a MIB-based zinc catalyst to generate allylic alkoxide intermediates. The intermediates are then subjected to in situ alkoxide-directed cyclopropanation to provide cyclopropyl alcohols. In the synthesis ofvinylcyclopropyl alcohols, hydroboration of enynes is followed by transmetalation of the resulting dienylborane to zinc to provide dienylzinc reagents. Enantioselective addition to aldehydes generates the requisite dienyl zinc alkoxides, which are then subjected to in situ cyclopropanation to furnishvinylcyclopropyl alcohols. Cyclopropanation occurs at the double bond allylic to the alkoxide. Using this method, syn-vinylcyclopropyl alcohols are obtained in 65–85% yield, 76–93% ee, and >19:1 dr. To prepare anti-cyclopropanols, enantioselective addition of alkylzinc reagents to conjugated enals provides allylic zinc alkoxides. Because direct cyclopropanation provides syn-cyclopropyl alcohols, the intermediate allylic alkoxides were treated with TMSCl/Et3Nto generate intermediate silyl ethers. In situ cyclopropanation of the allylic silyl ether resulted in cyclopropanation to form the anti-cyclopropyl silyl ether. Workup with TBAF affords the anti-cyclopropyl alcohols in one-pot in 60–82% yield, 89–99% ee, and ≥10:1 dr. For the synthesis of cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols, in situ generated (Z)-vinylzinc reagents were employed in asymmetric addition to aldehydes to generate (Z)-allylic zinc alkoxides. In situ cyclopropanation provides syn-cis-disubstituted cyclopropyl alcohols in 42–70% yield, 88–97% ee, and >19:1 dr. These one-pot procedures enable the synthesis of a",

It was found that the weight ratio of PVP to glass frit affected the distribution and number of silver nanoparticles. Moreover, the loading capacity of the glass frit, the pH value and reaction temperature could influence the size of the silver nanoparticles and morphology of silver on the surface of glass frit. The as-prepared silver-coated glass frit was used to prepare a silver paste using an optimized process to form silver nanoparticles with uniform size and high density. The silver paste with silver-coated glass frit increased the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells by 0.271% compared with the silver paste prepared with pure glass frit. The silver nanoparticles can promoted the precipitation of Ag crystallites on the silicon wafer. Therefore, the silver-coated glass frit can further optimize and enhance the electrical performance of solar cells.",

While the effect of irradiation on pure UHMWPE was found to increase crystallinity and cause higher enthalpy of crystallisation, grafted UHMWPE powders showed lower crystallinity and enthalpy of crystallisation. In all grafted UHMWPE there existed secondary transitions corresponding to grafting polymers in the first run of DSC above 60°C and they became clearer at a higher grafting level. In the second run of DSC some Tg values appeared to shift to higher temperatures while some were not detected. FTIR analysis indicated the presence of water-soluble polymers in the grafted UHMWPE.

Direct kinetic studies were performed over a temperature range of 300-700 K and pressures of 20 and 133 mbar.Vinylradicals (H2C=CH) were generated by laser photolysis ofvinyliodide (C2H31) at 266 nm, and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy was used to probevinylradicals through absorption at 423.2 nm. Measurements at 20 mbar are in good agreement with previous determinations at higher temperature. A weighted three-parameter Arrhenius fit to the experimental rate constant at 133 mbar, with the temperature exponent fixed, gives k = (7 +/- 1) x 10(exp -l4) cu cm/molecule/s (T/298 K)(exp 2) exp[-(1430 +/- 70) K/T]. RRKM master equation simulations, based on G3 calculations of stationary points on the C4H7 potential energy surface, were carried out to predict rate coefficients and product branching fractions. The predicted branching to 1-methylallyl product is relatively small under the conditions of the present experiments but increases as the pressure is lowered. Analysis of end products of 248 nm photolysis ofvinyliodide/ethylene mixtures at total pressures between 27 and 933 mbar provides no direct evidence for participation of I -methylallyl.",

The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of P(VCL-co-HEAA) was determined at 34.5°C. This thermo-responsive polymer was then grafted onto cotton fabrics using 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) as crosslinker and sodium hypophosphite (SHP) as catalyst. FTIR and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) studies confirmed the successful grafting reaction. The modified cotton fabric exhibited thermo-responsive behavior as evidenced by water vapor permeability measurement confirming decreased permeability at elevated temperature. This is the first demonstration that a PVCL based copolymer is grafted to cotton fabrics. This study provides a new thermo-responsive polymer for fabrication of smart cotton fabrics with thermally switchable hydrophilicity. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Evidently, all the additives used inhibited poly(vinylchloride) photodegradation at a significant level. The most efficient Schiff base exhibited a high level of aromaticity and contained a hydroxyl group. It seems possible that such photostabilization could be due to the direct absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the additives.

p,"The development of biodegradable materials is a challenging and important problem in polymer science. A review of the state of the art in degradable materials is presented, which reveals that current biodegradable materials do not exhibit the thermal or mechanical properties necessary for widespread applications. One strategy for toughening polymeric materials, which has previously been applied to non-degradable thermoplastics and thermoplastic elastomers, is the formation of block copolymers. Poly(vinylesters) (PVE) homopolymers are known to have a wide range of properties, but PVE block copolymers comprise a class of inexpensive and (bio)degradable materials that were previously unknown. Therefore, the synthesis and properties of these block copolymers were explored in an effort to develop robust degradable materials. This thesis research probes the reaction conditions necessary for the reversible-addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and chain extension reactions ofvinylester monomers. PVE di- and triblock copolymers are synthesized and studied, and the triblock copolymers display extremely poor toughness due to their relatively low molecular weights in light of the high entanglement molecular weight of the poly(vinylacetate) center block. Attempts to improve the mechanical properties of these materials focus on the incorporation of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as a low entanglement molecular weight and biocompatible center block in PVE-containing triblock copolymers. Depending on the choice of PVE endblocks and the overall polymer composition, crystallization of the PEO block can be controlled, confined, or inhibited. Polymers in which PEO crystallization is completely inhibited exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and behave as weak thermoplastics. In order to understand the relationship between the inhibition of PEO crystallization and the mechanical properties of PVE/PEO materials, these polymers were studied using dynamic",

The methacrylate endgroups cure with styrene via free radical copolymerization to yield thermoset networks. The copolymerization behavior of these networks was monitored by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) at various cure conditions. Reactions of the carbon-carbon double bonds of the methacrylate (943 cm-1) and styrene (910 cm-1 ) were followed independently. Oligomers possessing number average molecular weights of 700 g/mole were studied with systematically increasing levels of styrene. The Mortimer-Tidwell reactivity ratios indicated that at low conversion more styrene was incorporated into the network at lower cure temperatures. The experimentalvinylester-styrene network compositions deviated significantly from those predicted by the Meyer-Lowry integrated copolymer equation at higher conversion, implying that the reactivity ratios for these networks may change with conversion. The kinetic data were used to provide additional insight into the physical and mechanical properties of these materials. In addition to establishing the copolymerization kinetics of these materials, the development of halogen free fiber reinforcedvinylester composites exhibiting good flame properties was of interest. Flame retardantvinylester resins are used by many industries for applications requiring good thermal resistance. The current flame-retardant technology is dependent on brominatedvinylesters, which generate high levels of smoke and carbon monoxide. A series of halogen free binder systems has been developed and dispersed in thevinylester to improve flame retardance. The binder approach enables thevinylester resin to maintain its low",

Experiments with ethylvinylether required a modification of our established procedure that might introduce additional uncertainties, and the errors suggested reflect these difficulties. Rate coefficients are discussed in terms of electronic and steric influences. Atmospheric lifetimes with respect to important oxidants in the troposphere were calculated. NO 3-initiated oxidation is found to be the strongly dominating degradation route for 2-methylpent-2-ene, ( Z)-3-methylpent-2-ene and ethylvinylether. Atmospheric concentrations of the alkenes and their relative contribution to the total NMHC emissions from trucks can be expected to increase if plans for the introduction of particle filters for diesel engines are implemented on a global scale. Thus more kinetic data are required to better evaluate the impact of these emissions.",

Here, we assessedvinylsulfone small molecule peptide caspase inhibitors for potential use in vivo. The IC 50 of NWLvinylsulfone small molecule caspase inhibitors were determined on Caspase-1 to 10, and Caspase-6-transfected human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells. Inhibition of Caspase-6-mediated axonal degeneration was assessed in serum-deprived or amyloid precursor protein-transfected primary human CNS neurons. Cellular toxicity was measured by phase contrast microscopy, mitochondrial and lactate dehydrogenase colorimetric activity assays, or flow cytometry. Caspase inhibition was measured by fluorogenic activity assays, fluorescence microscopy, and western blot analyses. The effect of inhibitors on age-dependent cognitive deficits in Caspase-6 transgenic mice was assessed by the novel object recognition task. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry assessed the blood-brain barrier permeability of inhibitors in Caspase-6 mice.Vinylsulfone NWL-117 caspase inhibitor has a higher selectivity against Caspase-6, -4, -8, -9, and -10 whereas NWL-154 has higher selectivity against Caspase-6, -8, and -10.

Reactions that form racemic products proceed efficiently upon converting thevinylether to an α-chloro ether prior to cyanide addition in a pathway that proceeds through Brønsted acid-mediated chloride ionization. Enantiomerically enriched products can be accessed by directly protonating thevinylether with a chiral Brønsted acid to form a chiral ion pair. Me3SiCN acts as the nucleophile and PhOH serves as a stoichiometric proton source in a rare example of an asymmetric bimolecular nucleophilic addition reaction into an oxocarbenium ion.

These copolymers are produced by grafting ofvinylacetate onto polyethylene glycol (PEG) and subsequent hydrolysis of the poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(vinylacetate) graft copolymers. The poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(vinylacetate) copolymers are distributed with regard to molar mass and chemical composition. In addition, they frequently contain the homopolymers polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl acetate.

A necessary step for expanding our work in the next natural direction by examining the effects of the less electronegative, but more polarizable Cl atom is the determination of the structures of protic acid-vinylchloride complexes. Since the rich microwave spectrum of Ar-vinylchloride has not previously been reported, it is essential to first characterize this rare gas complex. We have observed strong b-type and weak a-type transitions for both 35Cl and 37Cl versions of this species, all of which appear to be doubled. Although ab initio calculations suggest a sufficiently large value of μ_c, c-type lines remain elusive. Indeed, these same calculations reveal the presence of several minima on the interaction potential energy surface, which may provide an explanation.",

The two groups had similar maternal characteristics and a similar distribution of severity ofNVP, although among Canadian women theNVPcontinued for slightly longer. American respondents were treated significantly more often by an obstetrician as their primary caregiver, were more commonly advised by their caregiver to change their diet and/or lifestyle and to use non-pharmacological agents to manage theirNVP, and more often perceived anti-emetics as posing an increased risk for malformations (all P < 0.001). Canadian respondents reported a family physician as their primary caregiver significantly more often, were more commonly advised to take anti-emetic medications and perceived theirNVPas causing a concern to their unborn (all P < 0.001).

Here the in vitro degradation behaviour with a special emphasis on elucidating structure-property relationships is reported. Effects of type and degree of amine substitution as well as PLGA side chain length were considered. In a first set of experiment, the weight loss of solvent cast films of defined size from 19 polymers was measured as a function of incubation in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C over a time of 21 days. A second study was initiated focusing on three selected polymers in a similar set up, but with additional observation of pH influences (pH 2 and pH 9) and determination of water uptake (swelling) and molecular weights during degradation. Scanning electron micrographs have been recorded at selected time points to characterize film specimens morphologically after degradation. Our investigations revealed the potential to influence the degradation of this polymer class by the degree of amine substitution, higher degrees leading to faster erosion. The erosion rate could further be influenced by the type of amine functionality, DEAPA-modified polyesters degrading as fast as or slightly faster than DMAPA-modified polyesters and these degrading faster than DEAEA-PVA-g-PLGA. As a third option the degradation rate could be modified by the PLGA side chain length, shorter side chains leading to faster erosion. As compared to linear PLGA, remarkably shorter degradation times could be achieved by grafting short PLGA side chains onto amine-modified PVA backbones. Erosion times from less than 5 days to more than 4 weeks could be realized by selecting the type of amine functionality, the degree of amine substitution and the PLGA side chain length at the time of synthesis.

PVP-b-PVAc self-assembles into polymer vesicles in aqueous media, and the dialysis method was used to load the water-insoluble drug (clofazimine) into these polymer vesicles. The polymer vesicles were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy to confirm vesicle formation and the incorporation of the anticancer drugs into the polymer vesicles. Dynamic light scattering was used to determine the particle size and particle size distribution of the drug-loaded vesicles as well as the stability of the vesicles under physiological conditions. The size of the polymer vesicles did not increase upon loading with clofazimine, and the particle size of 180-200 nm and the narrow particle size distribution were maintained. The morphology of the vesicles was examined by transmission electron microscopy. The polymer vesicles had a relatively high drug loading capacity of 20 wt %. In vitro cytotoxicity studies of PVP-b-PVAc and drug-loaded PVP-b-PVAc were performed against MDA-MB-231 multidrug-resistant breast epithelial cancer cells and MCF12A nontumorigenic breast epithelial cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the PVP-b-PVAc drug carrier showed no cytotoxicity, which confirms the biocompatibility of the PVP-b-PVAc drug carrier.

After screening a wide variety of substituents on the sulfur atom in alpha,beta-unsaturated sulfoxides, the readily available o-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenylvinylsulfoxide (1 i) has proved to be highly reactive with substituted terminal alkynes underN-oxide-promoted conditions (CH3CN, 0 degrees C). In addition, these Pauson-Khand reactions occurred with complete regioselectivity and very high diastereoselectivity (de=86->96 %, (S,R(S)) diastereomer). Experimental studies suggest that the high reactivity exhibited by thevinylsulfoxide 1 i relies on the ability of the amine group to act as a soft ligand on the alkyne dicobalt complex prior to the generation of the cobaltacycle intermediate. On the other hand, both theoretical and experimental studies show that the high stereoselectivity of the process is due to the easy thermodynamic epimerization at the C5 center in the resulting 5-sulfinyl-2-cyclopentenone adducts. When it is taken into account that the known asymmetric intermolecular Pauson-Khand reactions are limited to the use of highly reactive bicyclic alkenes, mainly norbornene and norbornadiene, this novel procedure constitutes the first asymmetric version with unstrained acyclic alkenes. As a demonstration of the synthetic interest of this sulfoxide-based methodology in the enantioselective preparation of stereochemically complex cyclopentanoids, we have developed very short and efficient syntheses of the antibiotic (-)-pentenomycin I and the (-)-aminocyclopentitol moiety of a hopane triterpenoid.",

However, addition of soluble drug substances causes concentration-dependent phase separation and rheological changes. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of adding a local anaesthetic, but keeping the concentration low in an attempt to prevent these changes. Cross-linked hydrogels prepared from three grades of poly(vinylalcohol) were characterised rheologically. Temperature sweep studies showed an elevated complex viscosity upon moving from 25°C to 80°C, which remained high for 48 h following completion of the cycle. Adhesion to model dermal surfaces achieved a maximum of 2.62Ncm(-2) and were greater than that observed to epidermal substrates, with a strong dependence on the rate of detachment used during testing. An optimised formulation (6% w/w PVA (31-50; 99) and 2% w/w THB) containing lidocaine hydrochloride loaded to an upper maximum concentration of 1.5% w/w was assessed for phase separation and drug crystallisation. After six months, crystallisation was present in formulations containing 0.7% and 1.5% lidocaine HCl. Changes in pH in response to increases in lidocaine loading were low. Drug release was shown to operate via a non-Fickian process for all three concentrations, with 60% occurring after approximately 24h. It can be concluded that using a low concentration of lidocaine hydrochloride in hydrogels based on poly(vinylalcohol) will result in crystallisation. Furthermore, these hydrogels are unlikely to induce rapid anaesthesia due to the low loading and slow release kinetics. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

p,"The advent of self-inflating hydrogel tissue expanders heralded a significant advance in the reconstructive potential of this technique. Their use, however, is limited by their uncontrolled isotropic (i.e., uniform in all directions) expansion. Anisotropy (i.e., directional dependence) was achieved by annealing a hydrogel copolymer of poly(methyl methacrylate-co-vinylpyrrolidone) under a compressive load for a specified time period. The expansion ratio is dictated by the percentage ofvinylpyrrolidonecontent and the degree of compression. The expansion rate is modified by incorporating the polymer within a silicone membrane. The in vivo efficacy of differing prototype devices was investigated in juvenile pigs under United Kingdom Home Office Licence. The devices were implanted within a submucoperiosteal pocket in a total of six porcine palates; all were euthanized by 6 weeks after implantation. A longitudinal volumetric assessment of the expanded tissue was conducted, in addition to postmortem analysis of the bony and mucoperiosteal palatal elements. Uncoated devices caused excessive soft-tissue expansion that resulted in mucoperiosteal ulceration, thus necessitating animal euthanasia. The silicone-coated devices produced controlled soft-tissue expansion over the 6-week study period. There was a statistically significant increase in the volume of expanded soft tissue with no evidence of a significant acute inflammatory response to the implant, although peri-implant capsule formation was observed. Attenuation of the bony palatal shelf was noted. A unique anisotropic hydrogel device capable of controlled expansion has been developed that addresses a number of the shortcomings of the technology hitherto available.",

Binary, ternary and quaternary dispersions containing GF, enteric polymer (Eudragit L100-55 or AQOAT-LF) and/orvinylpyrrolidone-based polymer (Plasdone K-12 povidone or S-630 copovidone) were processed by HME. Two plasticizers, triethyl citrate (TEC) and acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC), were incorporated to aid in melt processing and to modify release of GF in neutral media following a pH-change in dissolution. Products were characterized for GF recovery, degrees of compositional amorphous character, intermolecular interactions and non-sink dissolution performance. Binary dispersions exhibited lower maximum observed concentration values and magnitudes of supersaturated GF in neutral media dissolution in comparison with the ternary dispersions. The quaternary HME products, 1 : 2 : 1 : 0.6 GF : L100-55 : S-630 : ATBC and GF : AQOAT-LF : K-12 : ATBC, were determined as the most optimal concentration-enhancing compositions due to increased hydrogen bonding of enteric functional groups with carbonyl/acetate groups ofvinylpyrrolidone-based polymers, reduced compositional crystallinity and presence of incorporated hydrophobic plasticizer. HME products containing combinations of concentration-enhancing polymers can supersaturate and sustain GF dissolution to greater magnitudes in neutral media following the pH-transition and be compressed into immediate-release tablets exhibiting similar dissolution profiles. © 2015 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.",

Its severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), results in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, the need for hospitalisation and can, rarely, be fatal. This was a prospective, open-labelled, controlled, interventional study to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-emptive treatment ofNVPsymptoms in women who experienced severeNVPor HG in their previous pregnancy. Twenty-five women who reported severe symptoms ofNVPwith or without HG in their previous pregnancy were recruited and counselled to commence the use of antiemetics as soon as they became aware of the present pregnancy, and no later than the beginning of symptoms. They were followed-up prospectively through the index pregnancy for symptoms ofNVP, and were counselled continuously as to how to modify antiemetic doses based on symptoms. A comparison group consisted of randomly selected women also counselled by us forNVP, who had also had severeNVPin the previous pregnancy, but who did not call before a planned pregnancy and thus could not be offered pre-emptive therapy. The recruited women commenced pre-emptive drug therapy forNVPbefore conception or up to 7 weeks' gestation, before the appearance ofNVPsymptoms in all cases. In comparison to the previous pregnancy, only eight of these 18 women experienced a HG again in the index pregnancy (P = 0.01). The majority of study the women had an improvement in severity ofNVPsymptoms compared to the previous pregnancy. In the comparison group (n= 35), symptoms in the index pregnancy remained severe in 28 cases (80%), decreased to moderate in six (16.6%) and decreased to mild in five cases (13.9%). There were five cases of HG in the previous pregnancy and three in the index pregnancy. The pre-emptive group was improved significantly compared to the control group (P = 0.01). Pre-emptive symptom management appears to be effective in preventing severeNVPin general, and HG in particular. Women",

p,"Copper-assisted Ullmann-type coupling reactions are valuable transformations for organic synthesis. Researchers have extensively applied these reactions in both academic and industrial settings. However, two important issues, the high reaction temperatures (normally above 150 degrees C) and the stoichiometric amounts of copper necessary, have greatly limited the reaction scope. To solve these problems, we and other groups have recently explored the use of special ligands to promote these coupling reactions. We first showed that the structure of alpha-amino acids can accelerate Cu-assisted Ullmann reactions, leading to the coupling reactions of aryl halides and alpha-amino acids at 80-90 degrees C. In response to these encouraging results, we also discovered that an l-proline ligand facilitated the following transformations: (1) coupling of aryl halides with primary amines, cyclic secondary amines, andN-containing heterocycles at 40-90 degrees C; (2) coupling of aryl halides with sulfinic acid salts at 80-95 degrees C; (3) azidation of aryl halides andvinylhalides with sodium azide at 40-95 degrees C; (4) coupling of aryl halides with activated methylene compounds at 25-50 degrees C. In addition, we found thatN,N-dimethylglycine as a ligand facilitated Cu-catalyzed biaryl ether formation at 90 degrees C. Moreover, Sonogashira reactions worked in the absence of palladium and phosphine ligands, forming enamides fromvinylhalides and amides at temperatures ranging from ambient temperature up to 80 degrees C. Furthermore, we discovered that an ortho-amide group can accelerate some Ullmann-type reactions. This functional group in combination with other ligand effects allowed for aryl amination or biaryl ether formation at ambient temperature. The coupling between aryl halides and activated methylene compounds even proceeded at -45 degrees C to enantioselectively form a quaternary carbon center. Taking advantage of these results, we developed several novel approaches",

A total of 480 samples that included 557 CoNS isolates were obtained. Slime production was investigated with the Christensen method and methicillin-susceptibility was tested by the disk-diffusion method. There was a significant difference in the percentage of slime-producing CoNS isolates onvinyl(12.4%) versus ceramic tile flooring (4.4%). Fromvinylflooring, the percentage of slime producing methicillin-resistant CoNS (MRCoNS) (8.9%) was significantly higher than for methicillin-sensitive CoNS (MSCoNS) (3.6%), whereas there was no difference from ceramic tile flooring (2.5% MRCoNS versus 1.8% MSCoNS). The most commonly isolated slime-producing CoNS species was S. epidermidis on both types of flooring. It is concluded thatvinylflooring seems to be a more suitable colonization surface for slime-producing CoNS than ceramic tile floors. Further studies are needed to investigate bacterial strains colonized on flooring materials, which are potential pathogens for nosocomial infections.",

The homopolymerization of this new monomer using the RAFT/MADIX polymerization technique leads to the formation of novel well-defined and controlled polymers containing pendent bromine functional groups able to be modified via postpolymerization modification. Furthermore, the copolymerization ofvinylbromobutanoate with 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane (MDO) was also performed to deliver a range of novel functional degradable copolymers, poly(MDO-co-VBr). The copolymer composition was shown to be able to be tuned to vary the amount of ester repeat units in the polymer backbone, and hence determine the degradability, while maintaining a control of the final copolymers' molar masses. The addition of functionalities via simple postpolymerization modifications such as azidation and the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a PEG alkyne to an azide is also reported and proven by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, and SEC analyses. These studies enable the formation of a novel class of hydrophilic functional degradable copolymers using versatile radical polymerization methods.",

Aromatherapy is one of the types of complementary medicine that is used in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of aromatherapy with peppermint oil on the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP). This was a single-blind clinical trial that was conducted on 56 pregnant women with mild to moderate severity ofNVPand 6 to 20 weeks of gestational age. After the determination of gestational age and base severity ofNVPin each woman, they were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: peppermint oil (n=28) or placebo (n=28). Inhalation aromatherapy was done for four days and at the end of each day, they responded to the Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis/Nausea questionnaire (PUQE). The data obtained were analyzed with Mann-Whitney test and ANOVA with repeated measures using SPSS software version 22. Also, the level of significance was p<0.05. Although the severity ofNVPin each intervention group significantly decreased (p<0.001), the comparison of the severity ofNVPduring the study period and at the end of it was not statistically significant between the placebo and intervention groups. According to the possibility of neurological mechanisms causingNVP, the effect of aromatherapy with peppermint oil and placebo were the same in this study. This similarity can be due to psychological impacts of intervention on pregnant women.",

p,"BACKGROUND: Heartburn (HB) and acid reflux (RF) in the non-pregnant population can cause nausea and vomiting; therefore, it is plausible that in women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), HB/RF may increase the severity of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether HB/RF during pregnancy contribute to increased severity ofNVP. METHODS: A prospectively collected cohort of women who were experiencingNVPand HB, RF or both (n=194) was studied. The Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE) scale and its Well-being scale was used to compare the severity of the study cohort’s symptoms. This cohort was compared with a group of women experiencingNVPbut no HB/RF (n=188). Multiple linear regression was used to control for the effects of confounding factors. RESULTS: Women with HB/RF reported higher PUQE scores (9.6±2.6) compared with controls (8.9±2.6) (P=0.02). Similarly, Well-being scores for women experiencing HB/RF were lower (4.3±2.1) compared with controls (4.9±2.0) (P=0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that increased PUQE scores (P=0.003) and decreased Well-being scores (P=0.005) were due to the presence of HB/RF as opposed to confounding factors such as pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions/symptoms, hyperemesis gravidarum in previous pregnancies and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: The present cohort study is the first to demonstrate that HB/RF are associated with increased severity ofNVP. Managing HB/RF may improve the severity ofNVP. PMID:19373420",

Turbidimetry was used to assess their inverse temperature solubility behavior in dilute aqueous solution, with an LCST of approximately 55 °C being observed in the high molecular weight limit. Then a poly(glycerol monomethacylate) (PGMA) macro-CTA with a mean DP of 63 was chain-extended with NMEP using a RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization formulation at 70 °C. The target PNMEP DP was systematically varied from 100 up to 6000 to generate a series of PGMA63–PNMEPx diblock copolymers. High conversions (≥92%) could be achieved when targeting up to x = 5000. GPC analysis confirmed high blocking efficiencies and a linear evolution in Mn with increasing PNMEP DP. A gradual increase in Mw/Mn was also observed when targeting higher DPs. However, this problem could be minimized (Mw/Mn < 1.50) by utilizing a higher purity grade of NMEP (98% vs 96%). This suggests that the broader molecular weight distributions observed at higher DPs are simply the result of a dimethacrylate impurity causing light branching, rather than an intrinsic side reaction such as chain transfer to polymer. Kinetic studies confirmed that the RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization of NMEP was approximately four times faster than the RAFT solution polymerization of NMEP in ethanol when targeting the same DP in each case. This is perhaps surprising because both 1H NMR and SAXS studies indicate that the core-forming PNMEP chains remain relatively solvated at 70 °C in the latter formulation. Moreover, dissolution of the initial PGMA63–PNMEPx particles occurs on cooling from 70 to 20 °C as the PNMEP block passes through its LCST. Hence this RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization formulation offers an efficient route to a high molecular weight water-soluble polymer in a rather",

Nanofibers of poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA), poly(vinylacetate) (PVAc), and a 50:50 composite blend, loaded with ciprofloxacin HCl (CipHCl), were successfully prepared by an electrospinning technique for the first time. The morphology and average diameter of the electrospun nanofibers were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction studies indicated an amorphous distribution of the drug inside the nanofiber blend. Introducing the drug into polymeric solutions significantly decreased solution viscosities as well as nanofiber diameter. In vitro drug release evaluations showed that both the kind of polymer and the amount of drug loaded greatly affected the degree of swelling, weight loss, and initial burst and rate of drug release. Blending PVA and PVAc exhibited a useful and convenient method for electrospinning in order to control the rate and period of drug release in wound healing applications.

p,"A diblock copolymer poly(2-vinylpyridine)-b-poly(n-hexyl isocyanate) (P2VP-b-PHIC) is used for the present study. It has two blocks; a rod-shaped PHIC block that adopts a helical conformation, and a coil shaped P2VP block. In a polar solvent such as THF both PHIC and P2VP blocks are soluble. In mixtures of two solvents, such as THF and methanol, while the solubility of P2VP component is augmented that of PHIC is decreased leading to formation of reversed micelles. The pyridine nitrogen in P2VP block is a reactive site. It forms complexes with a suitable metal ion, such as Cd2+. The micelle is employed as a nanoreactor for synthesis of CdS quantum dot (QD). In this paper, the micellization behaviour of the copolymer and the use of the micelles for synthesis and controlled growth of CdS nanocrystals are demonstrated.",

p,"This paper reports measurements of the thermal dissociation of 1,1-difluoroethane in the shock tube. The experiments employ laser-schlieren measurements of rate for the dominant HF elimination using 10% 1,1-difluoroethane in Kr over 1500-2000 K and 43 < P < 424 torr. Thevinylfluoride product of this process then dissociates affecting the late observations. We thus include a laser schlieren study (1717-2332 K, 75 < P < 482 torr in 10 and 4%vinylfluoride in Kr) of this dissociation. This latter work also includes a set of experiments using shock-tube time-of-flight mass spectrometry (4%vinylfluoride in neon, 1500-1980 K, 500 < P < 1300 torr). These time-of-flight experiments confirm the theoretical expectation that the only reaction invinylfluoride is HF elimination. The dissociation experiments are augmented by laser schlieren measurements of vibrational relaxation (1-20% C(2)H(3)F in Kr, 415-1975 K, 5 < P < 50 torr, and 2 and 5% C(2)H(4)F(2) in Kr, 700-1350 K, 6 < P < 22 torr). These experiments exhibit very rapid relaxation, and incubation delays should be negligible in dissociation. An RRKM model of dissociation in 1,1-difluoroethane based on a G3B3 calculation of barrier and other properties fits the experiments but requires a very large DeltaE(down) of 1600 cm(-1), similar to that found in a previous examination of 1,1,1-trifluoroethane. Dissociation ofvinylfluoride is complicated by the presence of two parallel HF eliminations, both three-center and four-center. Structure calculations find nearly equal barriers for these, and TST calculations show almost identical k(infinity). An RRKM fit to the observed falloff again requires an unusually large DeltaE(down) and the experiments actually support a slightly reduced barrier. These large energy-transfer parameters now seem routine in these large fluorinated species. It is perhaps a surprising result for which there is as yet no explanation.",

The vibrational temperatures derived for the ν11 = 1, ν11 = 2, and ν15 = 1 states are 252 ± 76 K, 242 ± 121 K, and 227 ± 68 K, respectively; all of them are close to the mean kinetic temperature of the hot core component (210 K). The total column density of CH2CHCN in the ground state is (3.0 ± 0.9) × 1015 cm-2. We report the detection of methyl isocyanide (CH3NC) for the first time in Orion-KL and a tentative detection ofvinylisocyanide (CH2CHNC). We also give column density ratios between the cyanide and isocyanide isomers, obtaining aN(CH3NC)/N(CH3CN) ratio of 0.002. Conclusions: Laboratory characterization of many previously unassigned vibrationally excited states ofvinylcyanide ranging from microwave to THz frequencies allowed us to detect these molecular species in Orion-KL. Column density, rotational and vibrational temperatures for CH2CHCN in their ground and excited states, and the isotopologues have been constrained by means of a sample of more than 1000 lines in this survey.

Fibrous scaffolds of PVA, PVA/nHAp (10 wt.%), and PVA/nHAp(10 wt.%)/CNF(3 wt.%) were successfully fabricated and characterized. Tensile test on electrospun PVA/nHAp10 and PVA/nHAp10/CNF3 revealed a three-fold and seven-fold increase in modulus compared with pure ES-PVA (45.45 ± 4.77). Although, nanofiller loading slightly reduced the porosity percentage, all scaffolds had porosity higher than 70%. In addition, contact angle test proved the great hydrophilicity of scaffolds. The presence of fillers reduced in vitro biodegradation rate in PBS while accelerates biomineralization in simulated body fluid (SBF). Furthermore, cell viability, cell attachment, and functional activity of osteoblast MG-63 cells were studied on scaffolds showing higher cellular activity for scaffolds with nanofillers. Generally, the obtained results confirm that the 3-componemnt fibrous scaffold of PVA/nHAp/CNF has promising potential in hard TE. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Control group neonates were resuscitated by conventional drying under radiant warmer. Mean axillary and rectal temperature recorded immediately after admission to NICU were significantly higher in the study group compared to control group. Temperature recorded after 1 hour of admission to NICU were however comparable between the two groups. As temperature maintenance in these VLBW neonates is of tremendous importance, it would make sense to recommend the use ofvinylbags during their resuscitation.",

The ""surface-initiated vapor deposition polymerization"" (SI-VDP) of vaporizedvinylmonomers, via the nitroxide-mediated free radical polymerization mechanism, was developed to fabricate various homo- and block copolymer brushes from surface-bound initiators, 1-(4'-oxa-2'-phenyl-12'-trimethoxysilyldodecyloxy)-2,2,6,6-tetra-methylpiperidine (""TEMPO""). The resulting polymer thin films were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and contact angle goniometry, respectively, to identify the surface composition, film thickness, surface coverage, and water contact angles. Through the SI-VDP, end-grafted polymer films of polystyrene (PSt), poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc), poly(N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) (PHPMA), and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) with 10-200 nm thicknesses were fabricated. Furthermore, the block copolymer films of PAAc (1st block)-b-PSt (2nd block), PSt (1st block)-b-PAAc (2nd block), and a triblock copolymer film of PAAc (1st)-b-PSt (2nd)-b-PHPMA (3rd), were also fabricated, suggesting the ""renewability"" of the TEMPO-initiated polymerization in the SI-VDP scheme. It is also noticed that the SI-VDP is more efficient than the conventional solution phase polymerization in producing functional polymer brushes such as PNIPAAm, PAAc, or PAAc-b-PSt end-grafted films. In summary, our studies have shown clear advantages of the SI-VDP setup for the nitroxide-mediated polymerization scheme in controlling synthesis of end-grafted homo- and copolymer thin films.",

p,"Nanostructural engineering of inorganic substrates by free radical graft polymerization was studied with the goal of developing new membrane materials for pervaporation. Graft polymerization consisted of modification of surface hydroxyls withvinyltrimethoxysilane, followed by solution graft polymerization reaction using eithervinylacetate (VAc) orvinylpyrrolidone(VP). The topology of the modified surfaces was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on both atomically smooth silicon wafer substrates and microporous inorganic membrane supports in order to deduce the effects of modification on the nanostructural properties of the membrane. While unmodified wafers showed a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 0.21 +/- 0.03 nm, roughness increased to 3.15 +/- 0.23 nm upon silylation. Under poor solvent conditions (i.e., air), surfaces modified with higher poly(vinylacetate) (PVAc) or poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) polymer graft yields displayed lateral inhomogeneities in the polymer layer. Although RMS surface roughness was nearly identical (0.81--0.85 nm) for PVAc-modified surfaces grafted at different monomer concentrations, the skewness of the height distribution decreased from 2.22 to 0.78 as polymer graft yield increased from 0.8 to 3.5 mg/m2. The polymer-modified surfaces were used to create inorganic pervaporation membranes consisting of a single macromolecular separation layer formed by graft polymerization. PVAc grafted silica membranes (500A native pore size) were found selective for MTBE in the separation of 0.1--1% (v/v) MTBE from water, achieving MTBE enrichment factors as high as 371 at a permeate flux of 0.38 l/m2 hr and a Reynolds number of 6390; however, these membranes could not separate anhydrous organic mixtures. Pervaporative separation of methanol/MTBE mixtures was possible with PVAc and PVP-modified alumina supports of 50A native pore size, where the separation layer consisted of grafted polymer chains with estimated radius of",

CuO nanoparticles (NPs) were used as a suitable filler to fabricate the blend nanocomposites (NCs) with desired properties. First, the surface of NPs, was modified with vitamin B 1 (VB 1 ) as a bio-safe coupling agent. Then, the blend NCs with various ratios of modified CuO (3, 5, and 7 wt%) were fabricated under ultrasonic irradiations followed by casting/solvent evaporation method. These processes are fast and green way to disperse the NPs sufficiently. Several techniques were applied for the characterization of the obtained NCs. morphology examination demonstrated the morphology of NCs and compatibility of NPs with the blend polymer. EDX results indicated the weight and atomic percentage of the achieved materials. TGA analysis verified that the NCs show higher thermal properties than the neat blend polymer. Also embedding the modified NPs into the blend polymer had effected on optical absorbance of the obtained NCs. The contact angle measurements confirmed that the hydrophilicity decreased for different proportions of the modified NPs loaded in the blend polymer. Finally, NCs show better bactericidal effects against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Aromatherapy is one of the types of complementary medicine that is used in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of aromatherapy with peppermint oil on the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP). Methods: This was a single-blind clinical trial that was conducted on 56 pregnant women with mild to moderate severity ofNVPand 6 to 20 weeks of gestational age. After the determination of gestational age and base severity ofNVPin each woman, they were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: peppermint oil (n=28) or placebo (n=28). Inhalation aromatherapy was done for four days and at the end of each day, they responded to the Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis/Nausea questionnaire (PUQE). The data obtained were analyzed with Mann-Whitney test and ANOVA with repeated measures using SPSS software version 22. Also, the level of significance was p<0.05. Results: Although the severity ofNVPin each intervention group significantly decreased (p<0.001), the comparison of the severity ofNVPduring the study period and at the end of it was not statistically significant between the placebo and intervention groups. Conclusion: According to the possibility of neurological mechanisms causingNVP, the effect of aromatherapy with peppermint oil and placebo were the same in this study. This similarity can be due to psychological impacts of intervention on pregnant women.",

The effect of modification on luminescence properties for the samples was studied by photoluminescence (PL) spectra, electroluminescence (EL) spectra and time-resolved luminescence decay curves. Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) with the corresponded emitting layer structure were investigated. The results show that the amphiphilicity of the 8-vinylPOSS leads to well-dispersion state of the nano-TiO2 in the Alq3. Adding a proper weight percentage of 8-vinylPOSS is beneficial for the PL and EL properties enhancement of the composites. OLED using the Alq3/nano-TiO2 with 1 wt% 8-vinylPOSS emitting layer has the low turn-on voltage (4.7 V at 1 cd/m2), high maximum luminance (7463 cd/m2 at 8.75 V), and high luminous efficiency (1.13 cd/A at 100 mA/cm2). Adding 1 wt% 8-vinylPOSS in Alq3/nano-TiO2 can increase the EL intensity by a factor of 37.1 at 8 V. These values are better than those for OLEDs using the Alq3 emitting layer. The increase in luminance and current efficiency stability can be attributed to the energy transfer process between the Alq3 and the nano-TiO2, and the suppression of the self-quenching by caged 8-vinylPOSS molecules.",

p,"Polydivinylbenzene (PDVB) is a thermally stable, optically transparent, crosslinked polymer that until recently has been difficult to synthesize as a thin film. With the recent demonstration of initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) of thin PDVB films, a renewed interest in the material properties of PDVB has developed. In particular, attention is now focused on its oxidation pathways and long-term stability under the desired application use conditions. In this paper, we report on the thermal and environmental stability of PDVB films and show that unreacted pendantvinylgroups drive polymer oxidation upon exposure to either air or light. We demonstrate thatmore » suchvinylscan be effectively passivated by a simple ex-situ thermal annealing at ca. 300 °C in inert atmosphere that induces an 87% reduction of the PDVB oxidation rate in air and slows light (λ=405 nm) induced oxidation by 56%. While the thermal annealing is less effective at preventing oxidation under higher energy (λ = 365 nm) UV light, we demonstrate that this aging pathway is based on the presence of reactive oxygen species rather than traditional photo-oxidation. Finally,vinylremoval through ex-situ thermal annealing improves the chemical stability of iCVD PDVB to continuous air (over 500 days) or light (70 hours) exposure and offers a simple option to improve its environmental aging resistance which is important for long-term protective applications.« less",

The method allowed us to examine the influence of monomer pair structure on the kinetic profiles. The simultaneous consumption of both monomers was observed, supporting an alternating copolymerization mechanism. A lower reactivity of the blends containing maleates compared with fumarates was confirmed.

Whereas, the cloud point and pour point for EVA co-DEA were better, 10°C and 10-5°C respectively. In conclusion, EVA co-DEA had shown the best % PIE (28.42%) which indicates highest percentage reduction of wax deposit as compared to the other two inhibitors.",

p,"Due to the increased requirements of environmental protection, significant effort has been made to develop new ""green"" chemistry and engineering methods. Two effective approaches for ""green"" processes are: (1) to employ routes with fewer synthetic and separation steps, and (2) to replace volatile organic solvents with environmentally friendly solvents. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) has emerged as such a viable ""green"" alternative to organic solvents for several applications including extraction, polymerization, and nanotechnology, etc. In addition, it is an enabling solvent, allowing new types of chemistry and materials to be formed. In order to effectively utilize scCO2, it is required to study its effect on the relevant chemical process. This thesis focuses on the copolymerization of ethylene andvinylacetate in scCO2, and the application of scCO2 in the synthesis of novel poly(vinylacetate) (PVAc) and poly(ethylene-co-vinylacetate) (PEVA) nanocomposites. Firstly, the kinetics of the process was investigated. The thermal decomposition of the free-radical initiator diethyl peroxydicarbonate (DEPDC) was monitored by in situ attenuate total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) in heptane, and in scCO2. The rate constant and activation energy of the thermal decomposition of DEPDC in scCO2 were determined, and a decomposition mechanism was proposed. Further, with a knowledge of the initiator kinetics, in situ ATR-FTIR was employed to monitor the initial formation of copolymers of ethylene andvinylacetate during polymerization in scCO2. The reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of ethylene andvinylacetate in scCO2 were determined using both the Kelen-Tudos and the non-linear least-squares methods. The potential of scCO2 was further examined to synthesize advanced and novel nanomaterials based on an understanding of the polymerization mechanism. A novel one-step synthesis route was developed for making silica",

Using data onNVPseverity, treatment efficacy and outcomes, we compared the two groups of women: those treated with the combination of pyridoxine and doxylamine (treatment group,n=29) and those treated with metoclopramide (control group,n=29). Moderate to severe symptoms were present in 97% of the treatment group women vs. 69% of control group women (P < 0.01).

p,"HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a multifunctional enzyme that is targeted by nucleoside analogs (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). NNRTIs are allosteric inhibitors of RT, and constitute an integral part of several highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens. Under selective pressure, HIV-1 acquires resistance against NNRTIs primarily by selecting mutations around the NNRTI pocket. Complete RT sequencing of clinical isolates revealed that spatially distal mutations arising in connection and the RNase H domain also confer NNRTI resistance and contribute to NRTI resistance. However, the precise structural mechanism by which the connection domain mutations confer NNRTI resistance is poorly understood. We performed 50-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by essential dynamics, free-energy landscape analyses, and network analyses of RT-DNA, RT-DNA-nevirapine (NVP), andN348I/T369I mutant RT-DNA-NVPcomplexes. MD simulation studies revealed altered global motions and restricted conformational landscape of RT uponNVPbinding. Analysis of protein structure network parameters demonstrated a dissortative hub pattern in the RT-DNA complex and an assortative hub pattern in the RT-DNA-NVPcomplex suggesting enhanced rigidity of RT uponNVPbinding. The connection subdomain mutationsN348I/T369I did not induce any significant structural change; rather, these mutations modulate the conformational dynamics and alter the long-range allosteric communication network between the connection subdomain and NNRTI pocket. Insights from the present study provide a structural basis for the biochemical and clinical findings on drug resistance caused by the connection and RNase H mutations.

Recycled blends of poly(vinylchloride)/poly(methyl methacrylate) are successfully formed from the plastic constituents, those are recovered from waste computer products. However, lower impact performance of the blend and lower stability of the poly(vinylchloride) phase in the recycled blend restricts its further usage in industrial purposes. Therefore, effective utilisation acrylonitrile butadiene rubber in a recycled blend was considered for improving mechanical and thermal performance. Incorporation of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber resulted in the improvement in impact performance as well as elongation-at-break of the recycled blend. The optimum impact performance was found in the blend with 9 wt% acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, which shows 363% of enhancement as compared with its parent blend. Moreover, incorporated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber also stabilises the poly(vinylchloride) phase present in the recycled blend, similarly Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies indicate the interactions of various functionalities present in the recycled blend and acrylonitrile butadiene rubber. In addition to this, thermogravimetric analysis indicates the improvement in the thermal stability of the recycled blend after the addition of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber into it. The existence of partial miscibility in the recycled blend was identified using differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy.",

However, conflicting reports make it difficult to compare the effects of movement on chemical permeation through commonly available glove types. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of movement on chemical permeation of an organic solvent through disposable latex, nitrile, andvinylgloves. Simulated whole-glove permeation testing was conducted using ethyl alcohol and a previously designed permeation test system. With exposure to movement, a significant decrease (p ≤ 0.001) in breakthrough time (BT) was observed for the latex (-23%) and nitrile gloves (-31%). With exposure to movement, only the nitrile glove exhibited a significant increase (p ≤ 0.001) in steady-state permeation rate (+47%) and cumulative permeation at 30 min (+111%). Even though the nitrile glove provided optimum chemical resistance against ethyl alcohol, it was most affected by movement. With exposure to movement, the latex glove was an equivalent option for overall worker protection, because it was less affected by movement and the permeation rate was lower than that of the nitrile glove. In contrast, thevinylglove was the least affected by movement, but did not provide adequate chemical resistance to ethyl alcohol in comparison with the nitrile and latex gloves. Glove selection should take movement and polymer type into account. Some glove polymer types are less affected by movement, most notably the latex glove in this test. With nitrile gloves, at least a factor of three should be used when attempting to assign a protection factor when repetitive hand motions are anticipated. Ultimately, the latex gloves outperformed nitrile andvinylin these tests, which evaluated the effect of movement on chemical permeation. Future research should aim to resolve some of the observed discrepancies in test results with latex andvinylgloves.",

Therefore, we assessed the susceptibility and mutation patterns of first line NNRTI failure and the possibility of using RPV compared to ETV in patients who have failed efavirenz(EFV)- and nevirapine(NVP)-based regimens. Clinical samples with confirmed virological failure from EFV- orNVP-based regimens were retrospectively analyzed. Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were interpreted by IAS-USA Drug Resistance Mutations. Susceptibility of ETR and RPV were interpreted by DUET, Monogram scoring system, and Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database. 1,279 and 528 patients failed EFV- andNVP-based regimens, respectively. Y181C was the most commonNVP-associated RAM (54.3% vs. 14.7%, p<0.01). K103Nwas the most common EFV-associated RAM (56.5% vs. 19.1%, P<0.01). The results from all three scoring systems were concordant. 165(11.1%) and 161(10.9%) patients who failedNVP-based regimen were susceptible to ETR and RPV, respectively (p = 0.85). 195 (32.2%) and 191 (31.6%) patients who failed EFV-based regimen, were susceptible to ETR and RPV, respectively (p = 0.79). The susceptibility of ETV and RPV in EFV failure was significantly higher thanNVPfailure (p<0.01). The mutation patterns for ETR and RPV were similar but 32% and 11% of patients who failed EFV andNVP-based regimen, respectivly were susceptible to RPV. This finding suggests that RPV can be used as the alternative antiretroviral agent in patients who have failed EFV-based regimen.",

Pristine CaCO3 NCs biocompatibility, cell interactions and internalization in in vitro experiments on T-cell lymphoma line, were studied. Confocal microscopy was used to monitor NCs-cell interactions and cellular uptake. We have further investigated the interaction nature and release mechanism of drug loaded/released within/from the NCs using an alternative approach based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Our approach provides a good loading efficiency, therefore this drug delivery system was validated for biological activity in T-cell lymphoma: the anti-proliferative test and western blot results are very interesting because the proposed nano-formulation has an efficiency higher than free drug at the same nominal concentration.

However, compound efficiencies as inhibitors ranked low (PImC 12 > PImC₈ > PImC₄) to reach 61% for PImC 12 in highly diluted acidic solution. Apparently, the high mobility of sulfates favored their adsorption in comparison to PILs. The surface film displayed general corrosion, and pitting occurred as a consequence of PILs' partial inhibition along with a continuous dissolution of defective patchy film on formation. A slight improvement in efficiency was displayed by compounds having high molecular weight and a long alkyl chain, as a consequence of steric hindrance and PIL interactions.",

This latter work also includes a set of experiments using shock-tube time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (4%vinylfluoride in neon, 1500--1980 K, 500 < P < 1300 torr), which confirm the theoretical expectation that the only reaction invinylfluoride is HF elimination.

A RRKM model of dissociation in 1,1-difluoroethane based on a G3B3 calculation of barrier and other properties fits the experiments but requires a very largedown of 1600cm-1 . Dissociation ofvinylfluoride has two parallel HF eliminations both three-center and four-center with nearly equal barriers. An RRKM fit to the observed falloff again requires an unusually largedown and the experiments actually support a slightly reduced barrier. Both 1,3,5-triazine and pyrazine relax extremely rapidly with energy transfer in a few collisions, any incubation delay can be confidently discounted in dissociation. 1,3,5-triazine dissociation experiments show fall-off with a clear pressure dependence. The three body product dissociation mechanism models this dissociation perfectly. Experimental data agree well with an RRKM calculation using adown of 1200cm-1 and a barrier E0 = 84.66 kcal/mol.

Amplification in intensity is ascribed to microscopic interactions results when a donation of nonbonding electron (n) occurs from a “>N–C=O” entity of PVP into a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the C60 molecule in PVP-C60 charge transfer (CT) complex. The C=O stretching band intensity (integrated) Vs C60 content plot exhibits a peak near a critical 13.9 μM C60 value owing to percolation effect. Light emission spectra show that even a small addition of 4.63 μM C60 able to suppress the band intensity by ~23% as a result of an energy loss. The integrated band intensity also decreases through a peak near 13.9 μM when plotted against the C60-content. In correlation to the vibration spectra, the maximum effect observed both in light emission and excitation spectra suggests a percolation effect in the CT complex. Exhibition of percolation threshold in C60-PVP donor-acceptor complex will be helpful in optimizing the photovoltaic properties vital for solar cell applications.",

This procedure was performed without any cross-linker or toxic reagents to generate porosity in the scaffold. Both morphology and thermal stability of the nanocomposite scaffold were examined. The swelling behavior, mechanical properties and hydrolytic degradation of the composite scaffolds were carefully investigated. Our results revealed that collagen, PVP and TiO2 are bonded together by four main hydrogen bonds, which is an essential action for the formation of nanocomposite scaffold. Using Coasts-Redfern model, we were able to calculate the thermal degradation apparent activation energy and demonstrated that the thermal stability of nanocomposites is dependent on amount of PVP incorporated. Furthermore, SEM images showed that the collagen fibers are wrapped and stabilized on scaffolds by PVP molecules, which improve the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The UTS of PVP-contained scaffold is four times higher than that of scaffold without PVP, whereas ultimate percentage of elongation (UPE) is decreased, and PVP can enhance the degradation resistance.

A thermoset nanocomposite was prepared with nanoparticles of calcined HAP (<100 nm, rod-like shape, filler content 30 wt.%), HT-PPFhm andN-vinylpyrrolidone, dibenzoyl peroxide andN,N-dimethyl aniline. Two more nanocomposites were prepared with precipitated HAP nanoparticles (<100 nm rod-like shape) and commercially available HAP nanoparticles (<200 nm spherical shape), respectively. Calcined HAP nanoparticles resulted in very good crosslinking in the resin matrix with high crosslinking density and interfacial bonding with the polymer, owing to the rod-like shape of the nanoparticles; this gave improved biomechanical strength and modulus and also controlled degradation of the nanocomposite for scaffold formation. The tissue compatibility and osteocompatibility of the nanocomposite containing calcined HAP nanoparticles was evaluated. The tissue compatibility was studied by intramuscular implantation in a rabbit animal model for 3 months as per ISO standard 10993/6. The in vivo femoral bone repair was also carried out in the rabbit animal model as per ISO standard 10993/6.

It is essential to suppress this phenomenon in a clinical setting because the pharmacokinetics must be reproducible. In this study, we evaluated the induction of the ABC phenomenon using nanoparticles coated with various hydrophilic polymers instead of PEG. Nanoparticles encapsulating prostaglandin E1 were prepared by the solvent diffusion method from a blend of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and block copolymers consisting of various hydrophilic polymers and PLA. Coating of nanoparticles with poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP), poly(4-acryloylmorpholine), or poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) led to extended residence of the nanoparticles in blood circulation in rats, although they had a shorter half-life than the PEG-coated nanoparticles. The ABC phenomenon was not induced upon repeated injection of PVP-coated nanoparticles at various time intervals, dosages, or frequencies, whereas it was elicited by PEG-coated nanoparticles. In addition, anti-PVP IgM antibody, which is estimated to be one of the crucial factors for induction of the ABC phenomenon, was not produced after injection of PVP-coated nanoparticles. These results suggest that the use of PVP, instead of PEG, as a coating material for colloidal carriers can evade the ABC phenomenon.",

We have identified this compound as a dimer of the starting material. Substitution at the alpha-position of the 2-vinylbenzaldehyde substrates blocks the competitive dimerization reaction and allows the reaction to proceed with yields generally greater than 90%.

This work is the first study on the behaviors of blood platelets at the nanostructured surface generated by electrospinning. Poly[acrylonitrile-co-(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)] (PANCNVP) that shows excellent antiplatelet adhesion ability was directly electrospun onto its dense membrane surface. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) samples were used as controls. The depth as well as the density of the nanofibers can be easily controlled. The results showed that the PANCNVP dense membrane certainly suppressed the activation and adhesion of platelets. However, whether the nanofibers and underlying membranes were composed of PAN or PANCNVP, the nanostructured surfaces promoted the activation, adhesion, and orientation of platelets. It was also found that, if the space between fibers was too large or the depth of fibers was too small, the nanostructured surface did not change the property of antiplatelet adhesion of PANCNVP. The promotion of activation and adhesion of platelets was obviously due to the presence of nanofibers, which induced the changes of surface topography and charge.

The materials consist of highly branched poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)s with peptide functionalised end groups in a continuous phase of crosslinked poly(vinylpyrrolidone). Functionalisation of the end groups of the branched polymer component with the GRGDS peptide produces a hydrogel that supports cell adhesion and proliferation. The materials provide a new synthetic functional biomaterial that has many of the features of extracellular matrix, and as such can be used to support tissue regeneration and cell culture. This class of high water content hydrogel material has important advantages over other functional hydrogels in its synthesis and does not require post-processing modifications nor are functional-monomers, which change the polymerisation process, required. Thus, the systems are amenable to large scale and bespoke manufacturing using conventional moulding or additive manufacturing techniques. Processing using additive manufacturing is exemplified by producing tubes using microstereolithography.",

These nanocoils and nanosprings are of single crystalline structure, with the characteristics wire diameters ranging from tens to a few hundreds of nanometers and the ring/coil diameters mostly ~10–35 microns. Their growth and deformation mechanisms were then investigated and discussed along with that of previously reported single-turn copper nanorings.

p,"A silk fibroin/poly (vinylalcohol) porous scaffold with a water vapor transmission rate of 2125 ± 464 g/m2/day has been developed via thermally induced phase separation (gelation) and freeze-drying process. A hierarchical architecture of micropores and nanofibers was observed inside the scaffolds, and the related structures were analyzed. The viability and proliferation of 3T3 fibroblasts were examined, which indicated that the scaffolds exerted low cytotoxicity. After loading curcumin, the scaffolds can suppress the growth of 3T3 fibroblasts. The release behavior of curcumin from the scaffolds was investigated. At pH = 7.2, the release profiles showed no significant difference for the loading amounts of 0.5 mg and 0.25 mg per sample. Meanwhile, the cumulative amount of released drug at pH = 5.7 was significantly more than that in neutral solution due to more degradation of the scaffolds. It was suggested that the silk fibroin/poly (vinylalcohol) blend scaffolds could be potentially used as wound dressing materials. PMID:26816634",

p,"Vinylcyanide 193 nm photodissociation has been studied using Chirped-Pulse Millimeter-Wave (CPmmW) spectroscopy. J = 0 - 1 transitions of more than 30 vibrationally excited states of the HCN and HNC products have been recorded and assigned within the 7 GHz wide chirp range. Bending excitations of HCN up to v_2 = 14, leading toward the HCN leftrightarrow HNC isomerization transition state, are detected and interpreted in terms of their electric quadrupole, (eQq)_{N}, and rotational, B_v, constants. The photolysis reaction transition states were probed using both normalvinylcyanide, CH_2=CHCN, and its singly-deuterated isotopologue, CH_2=CDCN. The observed difference in the vibrational population distribution (VPD) obtained from the integrated intensities of the HCN and DCN products from the CH_2=CHCN vs. CH_2=CDCN photolysis reactions, suggests the relative unimportance of the three-center elimination mechanism for HCN production. On the other hand, the similarity in the observed VPD and overall intensities of HCN from CH_2=CHCN and CH_2=CDCN photolysis suggests four-center elimination as the major mechanism leading to the HCN product. Additional J - (J + 1) transitions would be required to characterize both the vibrational and the rotational state distributions of the products, which would permit more complete characterization of the transition state(s).

p,"Nevirapine (NVP) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) widely used as a component of High Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) since it is inexpensive, readily absorbed after oral administration and non-teratogenic. In the present work, the mechanism of a previously described pharmacokinetic interaction betweenNVPand the antidepressant drug nortriptyline (NT) was studied using rat hepatic microsomes. The obtained results showed a competitive inhibition of theNVPmetabolism by NT. The three mainNVPmetabolites (2-OH-NVP, 3-OH-NVPand 12-OH-NVP) where competitively inhibited with similar inhibitory constant values (K i  = 4.01, 3.97 and 4.40 μM, respectively). Time-dependent inhibition of theNVPmetabolism was also detected, with a 2.5-fold reduction in the IC 50 values of NT for 2-, 3-, and 12-OH-NVPformation when NT was preincubated with the microsomal suspension in the presence of an NADPH-generating system. A concentration-dependent inhibition of the formation ofNVPmetabolites by the main NT metabolite (10-OH-NT) was also observed, however, the inhibitory potency of 10-OH-NT was much lower than that of the parent drug. The apparent hepatic intrinsic clearance ofNVPdetermined in these in vitro experiments was used to predict the in vivo clearance ofNVPusing the ""well-stirred"" and the ""parallel-tube"" models, resulting in values close to those previously observed in vivo clearance. Finally, a good prediction of the increase in the plasma concentrations ofNVPwhen co-administered with NT was obtained employing the inhibitory constant of NT determined in vitro and the estimated plasma concentration of NT entering the liver.

These compounds were tested as corrosion inhibitors on aluminum alloy AA6061 in diluted sulfuric acid (0.1–1 M H2SO4) by weight loss tests, polarization resistance measurements and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. Langmuir’s isotherms suggested film formation on bare alloy while standard free energy indicated inhibition by a physisorption process. However, compound efficiencies as inhibitors ranked low (PImC12 > PImC8 > PImC4) to reach 61% for PImC12 in highly diluted acidic solution. Apparently, the high mobility of sulfates favored their adsorption in comparison to PILs. The surface film displayed general corrosion, and pitting occurred as a consequence of PILs’ partial inhibition along with a continuous dissolution of defective patchy film on formation. A slight improvement in efficiency was displayed by compounds having high molecular weight and a long alkyl chain, as a consequence of steric hindrance and PIL interactions. PMID:28788156",

In the present study, we investigated the phospho-proteomic profile of RTKs and its correlation with downstream signaling pathways in human melanoma. We found that tyrosine kinase receptors expression correlated with the expression of pivotal downstream components of the RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in melanoma cell lines and tumors. We also found high expression of HSP90 and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway proteins, 4EBP1 and AKT compared with healthy tissue and this correlated with poor overall survival of melanoma patients. The combination of the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitorNVP-BEZ235 showed a synergistic activity decreasing melanoma cell growth, inducing apoptosis and targeting simultaneously the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. These results demonstrate that the combination of HSP90 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors could be an effective therapeutic strategy that target the main survival pathways in melanoma and must be considered to overcome resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma patients.

p,"Nevirapine (NVP) treatment is associated with serious skin rashes that appear to be immune-mediated. We previously developed a rat model of this skin rash that is immune-mediated and is very similar to the rash in humans. Treatment of rats with the majorNVPmetabolite, 12-OH-NVP, also caused the rash. Most idiosyncratic drug reactions are caused by reactive metabolites; 12-OH-NVPforms a benzylic sulfate, which was detected in the blood of animals treated withNVPor 12-OH-NVP. This sulfate is presumably formed in the liver; however, the skin also has significant sulfotransferase activity. In this study, we used a serum againstNVPto detect covalent binding in the skin of rats. There was a large artifact band in immunoblots of whole skin homogenates that interfered with detection of covalent binding; however, when the skin was separated into dermal and epidermal fractions, covalent binding was clearly present in the epidermis, which is also the location of sulfotransferases. In contrast to rats, treatment of mice withNVPdid not result in covalent binding in the skin or skin rash. Although the reaction of 12-OH-NVPsulfate with nucleophiles such as glutathione is slow, incubation of this sulfate with homogenized human and rat skin led to extensive covalent binding. Incubations of 12-OH-NVPwith the soluble fraction from a 9,000g centrifugation (S9) of rat or human skin homogenate in the presence of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) produced extensive covalent binding, but no covalent binding was detected with mouse skin S9, which suggests that the reason mice do not develop a rash is that they lack the required sulfotransferase. This is the first study to report covalent binding ofNVPto rat and human skin. These data provide strong evidence that covalent binding ofNVPin the skin is due to 12-OH-NVPsulfate, which is likely responsible forNVP-induced skin rash. Sulfation may represent a bioactivation pathway for other drugs that cause a skin rash.",

p,"Nevirapine (NVP) can cause serious skin rashes and hepatotoxicity. It also causes an immune-mediated skin rash in rats but not hepatotoxicity. This rash is caused by a metabolite ofNVP; specifically,NVPis oxidized in the liver to a benzylic alcohol (12-OH-NVP), which travels to the skin where it forms a reactive benzylic sulfate. This could both act as a hapten and induce a danger signal. In contrast, most of the covalent binding in the liver involves oxidation of the methyl group leading to a reactive quinone methide. In this study, we examined the effects ofNVPand 12-OH-NVPon gene expression in the liver and skin. BothNVPand 12-OH-NVPinduced changes in the liver, but the list of genes was different, presumably reflecting different bioactivation pathways. In contrast, many more genes were up-regulated in the skin by 12-OH-NVPthan byNVP, which is consistent with the fact that 12-OH-NVPis an obligate intermediate in the formation of the reactive sulfate in the skin. Genes up-regulated by 12-OH-NVPin the skin included TRIM63 (18-fold increase), S100a7a (7-fold increase), IL22-RA2 (4-fold increase), and DAPK1 (3-fold increase). TRIM63 acts as a ubiquitin ligase, which is consistent with protein damage leading to an increase in protein turnover. In addition, TRIM proteins are involved in inflammasome activation, and it appears that inflammasome activation is an essential step in the induction ofNVP-induced skin rash. S100A7 is considered a danger signal, and its upregulation supports the danger hypothesis. Upregulation of the IL-22 RA2 gene marks an immune response. DAPK1 is involved with inflammasome assembly through binding directly to NLRP3, a NOD-like receptor expressed in keratinocytes. These results provide important clues to howNVPcauses the induction of an immune response, in this case leading to skin rash.",

In this study, a simple approach to fabricate electrospun poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) mats decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by combining electrospinning and calcination was presented. AuNPs were decorated on the fiber mat surface through electrostatic interactions between positively charged aminosilane groups and negatively charged AuNPs. The size and coverage density of AuNPs on the fiber mats could be tuned by varying the calcination temperature. Calcination of AuNPs-decorated PVP fibers at 500 °C-700 °C resulted in the uniform decoration of high density AuNPs with very narrow gaps on every single fiber, which in turn contribute to strong electromagnetic SERS enhancement. The robust free-standing AuNPs-decorated mat which calcined at 500 °C (500/AuNPs-F) exhibited high SERS activity toward cationic (methylene blue, MB) and anionic (methyl orange, MO) dyes in single and binary systems with a detection range from tens ofnM to a few hundred μM. The fabricated SERS substrate demonstrated high reproducibility with the spot-to-spot variation in SERS signal intensities was ±10% and ±12% for single and binary dye systems, respectively. The determination of MB and MO in spiked river water and tap water with 500/AuNPs-F substrate gave satisfactory results in terms of the percent spike recoveries (ranging from 92.6%-96.6%) and reproducibility (%RSD values less than 15 for all samples).",

p,"Adult T-cell leukemia–lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive neoplasm etiologically associated with HTLV-1, is a chemoresistant malignancy. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is involved in folding and functions as a chaperone for multiple client proteins, many of which are important in tumorigenesis. In this study, we examinedNVP-AUY922 (AUY922), a second generation isoxazole-based non-geldanamycin HSP90 inhibitor, and confirmed its effects on survival of ATL-related cell lines. Analysis using FACS revealed that AUY922 induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis; it also inhibited the growth of primary ATL cells, but not of normal PBMCs. AUY922 caused strong upregulation of HSP70, a surrogate marker of HSP90 inhibition, and a dose-dependent decrease in HSP90 client proteins associated with cell survival, proliferation, and cell cycle in the G1 phase, including phospho-Akt, Akt, IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, Cdk4, Cdk6, and survivin. Interestingly, AUY922 induced downregulation of the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) in ATL cells. The PIM family (PIM-1, -2, -3) is made up of oncogenes that encode a serine/threonine protein kinase family. As PIM kinases have multiple functions involved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis, their downregulation could play an important role in AUY922-induced death of ATL cells. In fact, SGI-1776, a pan-PIM kinase inhibitor, successfully inhibited the growth of primary ATL cells as well as ATL-related cell lines. Our findings suggest that AUY922 is an effective therapeutic agent for ATL, and PIM kinases may be a novel therapeutic target. PMID:25263741",

p,"Pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid (PCA) is formed during a common post-translational modification (PTM) of extracellular and multi-pass membrane proteins. In this study, we developed a new predictor to predict the modification sites of PCA based on maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) and incremental feature selection (IFS). We incorporated 727 features that belonged to 7 kinds of protein properties to predict the modification sites, including sequence conservation, residual disorder, amino acid factor, secondary structure and solvent accessibility, gain/loss of amino acid during evolution, propensity of amino acid to be conserved at protein-protein interface and protein surface, and deviation of side chain carbon atom number. Among these 727 features, 244 features were selected by mRMR and IFS as the optimized features for the prediction, with which the prediction model achieved a maximum of MCC of 0.7812. Feature analysis showed that all feature types contributed to the modification process. Further site-specific feature analysis showed that the features derived from PCA's surrounding sites contributed more to the determination of PCA sites than other sites. The detailed feature analysis in this paper might provide important clues for understanding the mechanism of the PCA formation and guide relevant experimental validations. PMID:22174779",

p,"The preparation and properties of poly(vinylbenzoate) nanoparticle suspensions as molecular carriers are described for the first time. These nanoparticles can be formed by nanoprecipitation of commercial poly(vinylbenzoate) in water using Pluronic F68 as surfactant, to create spherical nanostructures measuring 200-250nm in diameter. These nanoparticles are stable in phosphate buffer and blood serum, and only slowly degrade in the presence of esterases. Pluronic F68 stabilizes the nanoparticle and also protects it from enzymatic degradation. Up to 1.6% by weight of a lipid-soluble molecule such as coumarin-6 can be introduced into the nanoparticle during nanoprecipitation, compared to a water-soluble compound (5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) which gave almost no loading. Kinetics experiments in phosphate buffer indicate that 78% of the coumarin-6 was encapsulated within the polymer matrix of the nanoparticle, and the residual 22% of coumarin-6 was surface-bound and quickly released. The nanoparticles are non-toxic in vitro towards human epithelial cells (IC(50)>1000μg/mL) and primary bovine aortic endothelial cells (IC(50)>500μg/mL), and non-bactericidal against a selection of representative test microbes (MIC >250μg/mL). These properties suggest that the poly(vinylbenzoate) nanoparticles may be suitable carriers for molecular delivery of lipophilic small molecules such as pharmaceutical and imaging agents.

p,"The understanding of the intestine contribution to drug biotransformation improved significantly in recent years. However, the sources of inter-individual variability in intestinal drug biotransformation, namely sex-differences, are still elusive. Nevirapine (NVP) is an orally taken anti-HIV drug associated with severe idiosyncratic reactions elicited by toxic metabolites, with women at increased risk. As such,NVPis a good model to assess sex-dimorphic metabolism. The aim of this study was to perform a comparative profiling ofNVPbiotransformation in rat intestine and liver and evaluate whether or not it is organ- and sex-dependent. Therefore, nevirapine-containing solutions were perfused through the intestine, in a specially designed chamber, or incubated with liver slices, from male and female Wistar rats. The levels ofNVPand its Phase I metabolites were quantified by HPLC-UV. Liver incubation experiments yielded the metabolites 2-, 3-, 8-, and 12-OH-NVP, being 12-OH-NVPand 2-OH-NVPthe major metabolites in males and females, respectively. Inter-sex differences in the metabolic profile were also detected in the intestine perfusion experiments. Herein, the metabolites 3- and 12-OH-NVPwere only found in male rats, whereas 2-OH-NVPlevels were higher in females, both in extraluminal (p<0.01) and intraluminal media. The metabolite 8-OH-NVPwas not detected in the intraluminal media from either males or females. In this study, important inter-sex differences were detected in both organs, providing further clues to the sex-dimorphic profile ofNVPtoxicity. Moreover, an extra-hepatic contribution toNVPbiotransformation was observed, strengthening the relevance of the intestinal contribution in the biotransformation of orally taken-drugs.

The addition of peracids with 4-8 carbons in their alkyl chains led to the formation of two regioisomers, with the prevalence of hydroxyesters bearing a primary free hydroxyl (4c-4e). This prevalence became more pronounced when peracids with longer alkyl chains (C10-C18) were used. In this case, only isomers 4f-4h were formed. The antioxidant activity of the resulting hydroxyesters was assessed by means of the conjugated autoxidizable triene (CAT) assay, and it was found out that the 4-vinylguaiacol antioxidant activity was significantly increased by grafting alkyl chains with 2-8 carbons.",

This study is a cross-sectional population-based study conducted in Norway. Pregnant women and mothers with children <1 year of age with current or priorNVPwere eligible to participate. Data were collected through an anonymous on-line questionnaire accessible from November 10 th , 2014 to January 31 st , 2015. Severity ofNVPwas measured using the 24-h Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis Scale (PUQE). Associations between severity ofNVP, daily life functioning and willingness to become pregnant again were tested using chi-square tests. Associations with global quality of life measured in terms of the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) were estimated using generalized linear models and reported as unstandardized regression coefficients (β) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 712 women withNVPwere included in the study.NVPwas significantly associated with several characteristics, including daily life functioning, quality of life and willingness to become pregnant again. The negative impact was greater the more severe the symptoms were, although considerable adverse effects were also seen among women with mild and moderateNVPsymptoms.

Approximately 99% of these men have been traced and their mortality experience studied. The overall standardised mortality ratio, 75-4, shows a significant reduction compared with the national rates. Four cases of liver cancer were found. Two of these have been confirmed by a panel of liver pathologists as angiosarcoma and two as not angiosarcoma. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that cancers other than those of the liver are associated with exposure tovinylchloride monomer. The two cases of angiosarcoma were found in men who had been exposed to high concentrations of the monomer although the second man died only eight years after first exposure. The industry in Great Britain has expanded considerably since the second world war with over 50% of men having entered with the last decade. Conclusions drawn about the effect ofvinylchloride monomer on the mortality experience of men in this industry must consequently be tempered by the reservation that the full impact may not yet be in evidence.

With the newly designedvinylthioether-modified thymidine (VTdT), we added labeling tags on cellular DNA, which could further be linked to fluorochromes in cells. Therefore, we successfully visualized the DNA localization within cells as well as single DNA molecules without other staining reagents. In addition, we further characterized this bioorthogonal DNA metabolic labeling using DNase I digestion, MS characterization of VTdT as well as VTdT-oQQF conjugate in cell nuclei or mitochondria.

This active compound immobilized in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) hydrogel could be very interesting for topical administration, as a dressing form for dermatological use. However, PVP hydrogel obtained by radiation-induced crosslinking can cause undesirable hydrolysis reactions in the active compound. The aim of this work was to verify the resveratrol stability after irradiation at 0.5 and 1 kGy in the presence of ethanol, methanol or tert-butyl alcohol. The integrity of these samples was compared to unirradiated resveratrol by HPLC. The PVP hydrogel matrix was characterized by gel fraction, swelling and in vitro biocompatibility test. The results of gel fraction and swelling degree were approximately 90% and 1600%, respectively. The cytotoxicity assay showed absence of toxicity for this formulation after crosslinking and sterilization, indicating that the PVP hydrogel formulation was appropriate for resveratrol immobilization to produce a dressing for dermatological use.",

The Fourier transform infrared spectra showed the evidence of copolymerization of hydrogel precursors as well as the interaction of CNT filler with the hydrogel matrices, as indicated by the shiftingmore » of peak intensity and position of several functional groups (O-H, C-H sp{sup 3}, C=O, C-N, C-O). The modification of hydrogel surface morphology and porosity owing to CNT insertion was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy images. The CNT insertion improved the mechanical strength of superabsorbent hydrogel composites. Moreover, insertion of CNT into hydrogel matrix remarkably increased the swelling capacity of superabsorbent composites up to 840%. This huge water absorption capacity of hydrogel composites offers promising applications in development of superabsorbent polymers.« less",

p,"Hydrogels are a class of polymers that can absorb water or biological fluids and swell to several times their dry volume, dependent on changes in the external environment. In recent years, hydrogels and hydrogel nanocomposites have found a variety of biomedical applications, including drug delivery and cancer treatment. The incorporation of nanoparticulates into a hydrogel matrix can result in unique material characteristics such as enhanced mechanical properties, swelling response, and capability of remote controlled actuation. In this work, synthesis of hydrogel nanocomposites containing magnetic nanoparticles are studied. At first, magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) with an average size 10 nm were prepared. At second approach, thermo and pH-sensitive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide -co-methacrylic acid-co-vinylpyrrolidone) (NIPAAm-MAA- VP) were prepared. Swelling behavior of co-polymer was studied in buffer solutions with different pH values (pH=5.8, pH=7.4) at 37 °C. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4) and doxorubicin were incorporated into copolymer and drug loading was studied. The release of drug, carried out at different pH and temperatures. Finally, chemical composition, magnetic properties and morphology of doxorubicin-loaded magnetic hydrogel nanocomposites were analyzed by FT- IR, vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that drug loading efficiency was increased by increasing the drug ratio to polymer. Doxorubicin was released more at 40 °C and in acidic pH compared to that 37 °C and basic pH. This study suggested that the poly (NIPAAm-MAA-VP) magnetic hydrogel nanocomposite could be an effective carrier for targeting drug delivery systems of anti-cancer drugs due to its temperature sensitive properties.",

p,Natural-synthetic blend nanofibres have recently attracted more interest because of the ability of achieving desirable properties. Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)-chitosan (Cs)-poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA) blend nanofibrous scaffolds were electrospun in 2:1:1.33 mass ratio of PCL:Cs:PVA. The presence of PCL in the blend leads to improvement in web hydrophobicity and helped the web to retain its integrity in aqueous media. The scaffolds were used in two forms of acellular and with mesenchymal stem cells. They were applied on burn (n= 12) and excisional cutting (n= 12) wounds on dorsum skin of rats. Macroscopic investigations were carried out to measure the wounds areas. It was found that the area of wounds that were treated with cell-seeded nanofibrous scaffolds were smaller compared to other samples. Pathological results showed much better healing performance for cell-seeded scaffolds followed by acellular scaffolds compared with control samples. All these results indicate that PCL:Cs:PVA nanofibrous web would be a proper material for burn and cutting wound healing.,

p,"BackgroundVinylchloride is a widespread groundwater pollutant and Group 1 carcinogen. A previous comparative genomic analysis revealed that thevinylchloride reductase operon, vcrABC, of Dehalococcoides sp. strain VS is embedded in a horizontally-acquired genomic island that integrated at the single-copy tmRNA gene, ssrA. Results We targeted conserved positions in available genomic islands to amplify and sequence four additional vcrABC -containing genomic islands from previously-unsequencedvinylchloride respiring Dehalococcoides enrichments. We identified a total of 31 ssrA-specific genomic islands from Dehalococcoides genomic data, accounting for 47 reductive dehalogenase homologous genes and many other non-core genes. Sixteen of these genomic islands contain a syntenic module of integration-associated genes located adjacent to the predicted site of integration, and among these islands, eight contain vcrABC as genetic 'cargo'. These eight vcrABC -containing genomic islands are syntenic across their ~12 kbp length, but have two phylogenetically discordant segments that unambiguously differentiate the integration module from the vcrABC cargo. Using available Dehalococcoides phylogenomic data we estimate that these ssrA-specific genomic islands are at least as old as the Dehalococcoides group itself, which in turn is much older than human civilization. Conclusions The vcrABC -containing genomic islands are a recently-acquired subset of a diverse collection of ssrA-specific mobile elements that are a major contributor to strain-level diversity in Dehalococcoides, and may have been throughout its evolution. The high similarity between vcrABC sequences is quantitatively consistent with recent horizontal acquisition driven by ~100 years of industrial pollution with chlorinated ethenes. PMID:21635780",

Sterilized liquors obtained after alkaline hydrolysis of corn cob or alkaline hydrolysis of the solid residue coming from acid hydrolysis of corn cob were employed as growth media in fermentations performed in shaker or bioreactor. The fermentative process allowed converting 2222.8 mg/L p-CA into 993.9 mg/L 4-VP.

p,"The relationship between mastitis and antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive, breast-feeding women is unclear. In the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals, and Nutrition (BAN) study, conducted in Lilongwe, Malawi, 2369 mother-infant pairs were randomized to a nutritional supplement group and to one of three treatment groups: maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART), infant nevirapine (NVP) or standard of care for 24 weeks of exclusive breast-feeding and 4 weeks of weaning. Among 1472 HIV-infected women who delivered live infants between 2004 and 2007, we estimated cumulative incidence functions and sub-distribution hazard ratios (HR) of mastitis or breast inflammation comparing women in maternal ART (n= 487) or infant nevirapine (n= 492) groups to the standard of care (n= 493). Nutritional supplement groups (743 took, 729 did not) were also compared. Through 28-weeks post-partum, 102 of 1472 women experienced at least one occurrence of mastitis or breast inflammation. The 28-week risk was higher for maternal ART (risk difference (RD) 4.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9, 8.1) and infantNVP(RD 3.6, 95% CI 0.3, 6.9) compared to standard of care. The hazard of late-appearing mastitis or breast inflammation (from week 5-28) was also higher for maternal ART (HR 6.7, 95% CI 2.0, 22.6) and infantNVP(HR 5.1, 95% CI 1.5, 17. 5) compared to the standard of care. Mastitis or breast inflammation while breast-feeding is a possible side effect for women taking prophylactic ART and women whose infants takeNVP, warranting additional research in the context of postnatal HIV transmission. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

p,"Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive neoplasm etiologically associated with HTLV-1, is a chemoresistant malignancy. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is involved in folding and functions as a chaperone for multiple client proteins, many of which are important in tumorigenesis. In this study, we examinedNVP-AUY922 (AUY922), a second generation isoxazole-based non-geldanamycin HSP90 inhibitor, and confirmed its effects on survival of ATL-related cell lines. Analysis using FACS revealed that AUY922 induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis; it also inhibited the growth of primary ATL cells, but not of normal PBMCs. AUY922 caused strong upregulation of HSP70, a surrogate marker of HSP90 inhibition, and a dose-dependent decrease in HSP90 client proteins associated with cell survival, proliferation, and cell cycle in the G1 phase, including phospho-Akt, Akt, IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, Cdk4, Cdk6, and survivin. Interestingly, AUY922 induced downregulation of the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) in ATL cells. The PIM family (PIM-1, -2, -3) is made up of oncogenes that encode a serine/threonine protein kinase family. As PIM kinases have multiple functions involved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis, their downregulation could play an important role in AUY922-induced death of ATL cells. In fact, SGI-1776, a pan-PIM kinase inhibitor, successfully inhibited the growth of primary ATL cells as well as ATL-related cell lines. Our findings suggest that AUY922 is an effective therapeutic agent for ATL, and PIM kinases may be a novel therapeutic target. © 2014 The Authors.

Patient-reported maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were compared for women with and withoutNVPand within theNVPgroup for those with and without poor weight gain. 6.4% of women reportedNVPas a pregnancy complication. Women reportingNVPwere more likely to be younger, obese, single and smoke. They had higher rates of preterm delivery, pregnancy-induced hypertension and low birth weight <2500 g. Almost one-quarter of women withNVPhad lower than recommended weight gain. Poor weight gain was associated with a higher incidence of adverse outcomes. Obesity, tobacco use and poor pregnancy weight gain independently increased the odds of an adverse outcome.NVPand subsequent poor weight gain may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.",
